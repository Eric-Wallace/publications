We introduce \name{}, an interactive framework that combines active
learning \emph{selection}s with topic model \emph{overview}s to help
users induce a label set and label documents. We show that users can
more effectively and efficiently induce label set and create training
data using \name{} in comparison with other conditions, which lack
either topic \emph{overview} or active \emph{selection}.

We can further improve \name{} (the \abr{ta} condition) to help users
gain better and faster understanding of text corpora.  Our current
system limits users to view only $20K$ documents at a time and allows
for one label assignment per document. Moreover, the topics are static
and do not change over time. Users should have better support for
browsing documents and assigning multiple labels.  Topics can also
improve via \abr{slda}~\cite{blei-07b} or
\abr{llda}~\cite{ramage2009labeled} as users add labels.

Finally, with slight changes to what the system
considers a document, we believe \name{} can be extended to \abr{nlp} applications
other than classification, such as named entity recognition or
semantic role labeling, to reduce the annotation effort.
