@Comment Reduction of reinforcement learning to classification to learn WHEN to answer a question.
@Comment In this section, we discuss previous approaches that explore how much effort or resources a classifier needs to come to a decision, a problem not as thor- oughly examined as the question of whether the de- cision is right or not.2 Incremental classification is
@Comment 2When have an externally interrupted feature stream, the setting is called “any time” (Boddy and Dean, 1989; Horsch and Poole, 1998). Like “budgeted” algorithms (Wang et al., 2010), these are distinct but related problems.

This man resigned Q from one of his posts when the President sent a letter to Germany protesting the Lusi- tania Q sinking, and Q he advocated Q coining Q silver at a 16 Q to 1 QQ rate Q compared to Q gold. He was the Q three-time Democratic Q Party QQQ nominee for Q President Q but QQQ lost to McKinley twice QQ and then Taft, although he served as Secretary of State QQ under Woodrow Wilson, Q and he later argued Q against Clarence Darrow Q in the Scopes QQ Monkey Trial. For ten points, name this Q man who famously declared that “we shall not be crucified on a Cross of Q Gold”. Q
@Comment not equivalent to missing features, which have been studied at training time (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2011), test time (Saar-Tsechansky and Provost, 2007), and in an online setting (Rostamizadeh et al., 2011). In contrast, incremental classification allows the learner to decide whether to acquire additional features.

@Comment In a Simple Recurrent Network simulation and an eye- tracking study, we investigated the processing of clause- final verbs. Following the integration cost hypothesis (Gibson, 1998), processing verbs should be the harder, the more complement integrations have to take place. In contrast, probabilistic prediction-based models, like Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs, Elman, 1990), might anticipate verbs the better, the more dependents have been encountered beforehand. We trained SRNs with a subset of the German language to establish basic dependency relationships between verbs and their arguments in both verb-second and verb-final constructions. The test results established a clear anticipation hypothesis: the more arguments precede the verb, the lower the prediction error and hence, predicted reading times.
@Comment The data from an eye-tracking experiment confirm the anticipation hypothesis: Clause final verbs are read faster when an additional Dative, instead of a noun-modifying Genitive, is read beforehand. Adverbial PP-adjuncts, in contrast to Noun-modifying PPs, however, did not affect reading times. In general, the results support a restricted anticipation hypothesis.
