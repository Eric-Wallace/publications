abstract ={Although various ontologies and knowledge sources have been developed in recent years to facilitate biomedical research, it is difficult to assimilate information from multiple knowledge sources. To enable researchers to easily gain understanding of a biomedical concept, a biomedical Semantic Web that seamlessly integrates knowledge from biomedical ontologies, publications and patents would be very helpful. In this paper, current research efforts in representing biomedical knowledge in Semantic Web languages are surveyed. Techniques are presented for information retrieval and knowledge discovery from the Semantic Web that extend traditional keyword search and database querying techniques. Finally, some of the challenges that have to be addressed to make the vision of a biomedical Semantic Web a reality are discussed.},

  INSTITUTION =   {Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University},
  ABSTRACT =      {The standard interpretation of the logical operators in a Boolean retrieval system is in general too strict. A standard Boolean query rarely comes close to retrieving all and only those documents which are relevant to the user. An AND query is often too narrow and an OR query is often too broad. The choice of the AND results in retrieving on the left end of a typical average recall-precision graph, while the choice of the OR results in retrieving on the right end, implying a tradeoff between precision and recall. This study basically examines various proposed schemes, the P-norm, Classical Fuzzy-Set, MMM, Paice and TIRS, which provide means to soften the interpretation of the logical operators, and thus to attain both high precision and high recall search performance. Each of the above schemes has shown great improvement over the standard Boolean scheme in terms of retrieval effectiveness. The differences in retrieval effectiveness between P-norm, Paice and MMM are shown to be relatively small. However, related performance results obtained gives evidence of the ranking: P-norm, Paice, MMM and then TIRS. },

    abstract = {Clustering is a useful technique that organizes a large quantity of unordered text documents into a small number of meaningful and coherent clusters, thereby providing a basis for intuitive and informative navigation and browsing mechanisms. Partitional clustering algorithms have been recognized to be more suitable as opposed to the hierarchical clustering schemes for processing large datasets. A wide variety of distance functions and similarity measures have been used for clustering, such as squared Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and relative entropy. In this paper, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of these measures in partitional clustering for text document datasets. Our experiments utilize the standard K-means algorithm and we report results on seven text document datasets and five distance/similarity measures that have been most commonly used in text clustering.},

                 identifying possible terrorists. Yet 'big data' can
                 also be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists

                 reduces taxpayer costs. In order to achieve this goal,
                 researchers must have access to this data - raising
                 important privacy questions. What are the ethical and
                 legal requirements? What are the rules of engagement?
                 What are the best ways to provide access while also

                 mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss? The
                 goal of this book is to answer some of these questions.

                 The authors also identify new practical approaches that

abstract = "Publisher Summary Record linkage consists of methods for matching duplicates within or across files using nonunique identifiers, such as first name, last name, date of birth, address, and other such characteristics. These identifiers are referred to as ?quasi-identifiers.? In combination, quasi-identifiers may uniquely identify an individual. Modern computerized record linkage began with the methods introduced by a geneticist Howard Newcombe, who used odds ratios (likelihood ratios) and value-specific, frequency-based probabilities. This chapter gives a background on the Fellegi and Sunter model and several of the practical methods that are necessary for dealing with (often exceptionally) the ?messy? data. Although the methods rely on statistical models, most development has been done by computer scientists using machine learning or database methods. Computer scientists refer to record linkage as ?entity resolution? or ?object identification.? Applications of record linkage are numerous. The updating and list maintenance can ensure that there is good coverage of a desired population. The largest applications of record linkage are often during a population census or in updating an administrative list, such as a national health directory or death index. Large typographical variations or errors in the fields such as first name, last name, and date of birth in a moderate proportion of records can make the updating quite difficult. "

abstract = "There is a very real sense that in the aftermath of the limited success of the development paradigm (recipe) of the Washington consensus based on the pillars of liberalization, privatization and deregulation, new and challenging thinking and analysis need to be brought to bear on the problems faced by developing countries. While sound macro policies and low inflation are undoubtedly important precursors to self sustainable growth, they are not in themselves sufficient to deliver development. We argue that if development is a matter of self transformation arising from within an economy, then innovation must play a central role in the process and so to must the capacity for an economy to develop, integrate and adapt to novelty. This is at the core of the concept of self sustaining development and indeed why development is an emergent phenomenon. Thus the key questions for policy makers are: How can a transformation of innovation performance be achieved in a competitive international economy? What are the appropriate policy instruments? What role is there for universities? What stimuli can be given to entrepreneurial action? We explore these in terms of a critical evaluation of the idea of innovation systems and of the nature of innovation policy appropriate to innovation based development. "
