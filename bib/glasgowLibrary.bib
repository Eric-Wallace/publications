	abstract = {Humans are remarkably efficient at categorizing natural scenes. In fact, scene categories can be decoded from functional {MRI} ({fMRI)} data throughout the ventral visual cortex, including the primary visual cortex, the parahippocampal place area ({PPA)}, and the retrosplenial cortex ({RSC).} Here we ask whether, and where, we can still decode scene category if we reduce the scenes to mere lines. We collected {fMRI} data while participants viewed photographs and line drawings of beaches, city streets, forests, highways, mountains, and offices. Despite the marked difference in scene statistics, we were able to decode scene category from {fMRI} data for line drawings just as well as from activity for color photographs, in primary visual cortex through {PPA} and {RSC.} Even more remarkably, in {PPA} and {RSC}, error patterns for decoding from line drawings were very similar to those from color photographs. These data suggest that, in these regions, the information used to distinguish scene category is similar for line drawings and photographs. To determine the relative contributions of local and global structure to the human ability to categorize scenes, we selectively removed long or short contours from the line drawings. In a category-matching task, participants performed significantly worse when long contours were removed than when short contours were removed. We conclude that global scene structure, which is preserved in line drawings, plays an integral part in representing scene categories.},

First, we developed a framework for the classification of image descriptions by users, based on various classification methods from the literature. The classification framework distinguishes three related viewpoints on images, namely nonvisual metadata, perceptual descriptions and conceptual descriptions. For every viewpoint a set of descriptive classes and relations is specified. We used the framework in an empirical study, in which image descriptions were formulated by 30 participants. The resulting descriptions were split into fragments and categorized in the framework. The results suggest that users prefer general descriptions as opposed to specific or abstract descriptions. Frequently used categories were objects, events and relations between objects in the image.},

In humans, the ventral temporal Parahippocampal Place Area ({PPA)} has been implicated in scene processing, but scene information is contained in many visual areas, leaving their specific contributions unclear. While early theories of {PPA} emphasized its role in spatial processing, more recent reports of its function have emphasized semantic or contextual processing. Here, using functional imaging, we reconstructed the organization of scene representations across human ventral visual cortex by analyzing the distributed response to 96 diverse real-world scenes. We found that while individual scenes could be decoded in both {PPA} and early visual cortex ({EVC)}, the structure of representations in these regions was vastly different. In both regions spatial rather than semantic factors defined the structure of representations. However, in {PPA}, representations were defined primarily by the spatial factor of expanse (open, closed) and in {EVC} primarily by distance (near, far). Further, independent behavioral ratings of expanse and distance correlated strongly with representations in {PPA} and {pEVC}, respectively. In neither region was content (manmade, natural) a major contributor to the overall organization. Further, the response of {PPA} could not be used to decode the high-level semantic category of scenes even when spatial factors were held constant, nor could category be decoded across different distances. These findings demonstrate, contrary to recent reports, that the response {PPA} primarily reflects spatial, not categorical or contextual aspects of real-world scenes.},

	abstract = {Logistic regression has been used as a supervised method for extracting {EEG} components predictive of binary perceptual decisions. However, often perceptual decisions require a choice between more than just two alternatives. In this paper we present results using multinomial logistic regression ({MLR)} for learning {EEG} components in a 3-way visual discrimination task. Subjects were required to decide between three object classes (faces, houses, and cars) for images which were embedded with varying amounts of noise. We recorded the subjects' {EEG} while they were performing the task and then used {MLR} to predict the stimulus category, on a single-trial basis, for correct behavioral responses. We found an early component (at 170ms) that was consistent across all subjects and with previous binary discrimination paradigms. However a later component (at 300-400ms), previously reported in the binary discrimination paradigms, was more variable across subjects in this three-way discrimination task. We also computed forward models for the {EEG} components, with these showing a difference in the spatial distribution of component activity for the different categorical decisions. In summary, we find that logistic regression, generalized to the arbitrary N-class case, can be a useful approach for learning and analyzing {EEG} components underlying multi-class perceptual decisions.},

	abstract = {In a national and international economy that requires fluid movement of both labor and capital, it is important to know that families and other helping institutions can mitigate the losses of social capital that may accompany family migration. Coleman's (1990) theory of social capital emphasizes the roles of mothers and fathers in enhancing the life prospects of their children. However, Coleman's (1988) analysis of family migration and high school completion found an anomalous null effect of parental support. Elder's (1994) life course perspective on "linked lives" suggests that parental involvement with their children can have interactive effects as well as main effects in mitigating losses of community social capital resulting from a family's moves. Following this lead and using more elaborate measures, we find that the negative effects of family migration are significantly more pronounced in families with uninvolved fathers and unsupportive mothers. In these families the diminished social capital provided by parents does not compensate for the community social capital lost as a result of a family's move.},

M-{OntoMat-Annotizer} allows for linking low level {MPEG-7} visual descriptions to conventional Semantic Web ontologies and annotations. We use M-{OntoMat-Annotizer} in order to construct ontologies that include prototypical instances of high-level domain concepts together with a formal specification of corresponding visual descriptors. Thus, we formalize the interrelationship of high- and low-level multimedia concept descriptions allowing for new kinds of multimedia content analysis and reasoning.},

We start with a brief summary of the initial challenges, followed by a discussion of the initial driving domains and applications. These are followed by a selection of additional applications and domains that have been a part of recent rapid expansion of visual analytics usage. We then look at the common characteristics of several tools illustrating emerging visual analytics technologies and conclude with the top 10 challenges for the field of study. We encourage feedback and continued participation by members of the research community, the wide array of user communities and private industry.},

The results indicated the applicability of low self-control theory in explaining both illegal download of software and illegal use of others’ personal identification online. Consistent with the theory's prediction, opportunity variables, especially hours of computer use, were found to be significant predictors of computer crime.

	abstract = {The {U.S.} intelligence community ({IC)} is a complex human enterprise whose success depends on how well the people in it perform their work. Although often aided by sophisticated technologies, these people ultimately rely on their own intellect to identify, synthesize, and communicate the information on which the nation's security depends. The {IC's} success depends on having trained, motivated, and thoughtful people working within organizations able to understand, value, and coordinate their capabilities. Intelligence Analysis provides up-to-date scientific guidance for the intelligence community ({IC)} so that it might improve individual and group judgments, communication between analysts, and analytic processes. The papers in this volume provide the detailed evidentiary base for the National Research Council's report, Intelligence Analysis for Tomorrow: Advances from the Behavioral and Social Sciences. The opening chapter focuses on the structure, missions, operations, and characteristics of the {IC} while the following 12 papers provide in-depth reviews of key topics in three areas: analytic methods, analysts, and organizations. Informed by the {IC's} unique missions and constraints, each paper documents the latest advancements of the relevant science and is a stand-alone resource for the {IC's} leadership and workforce. The collection allows readers to focus on one area of interest (analytic methods, analysts, or organizations) or even one particular aspect of a category. As a collection, the volume provides a broad perspective of the issues involved in making difficult decisions, which is at the heart of intelligence analysis.},

The article tests this idea using data collected via a web-administered behavior-tracking study with subjects recruited from the readership of 2 partisan online news sites (N = 727). The results demonstrate that opinion-reinforcing information promotes news story exposure while opinion-challenging information makes exposure only marginally less likely. The influence of both factors is modest, but opinion-reinforcing information is a more important predictor. Having decided to view a news story, evidence of an aversion to opinion challenges disappears: There is no evidence that individuals abandon news stories that contain information with which they disagree. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

While various sentence similarity measures have recently been proposed, these measures typically only take into account word importance by virtue of inverse document frequency ({IDF)} weighting. {IDF} values are based on global information compiled over a large corpus of documents, and we hypothesise that at the sentence level better performance can be achieved by using a measure of the importance of a word within the sentence that it appears. In this paper we show how the {PageRank} graph-centrality algorithm can be used to assign a numerical measure of importance to each word in a sentence, and how these values can be incorporated within various sentence similarity measures. Results from applying the measures to a difficult sentence clustering task demonstrates that incorporation of sentential word importance leads to statistically significant improvement in clustering performance as evaluated using a range of external clustering criteria.},

In this paper, we develop theoretical results for three overlapping classes of probabilistic models for best, worst, and best–worst choices, with the models in each class proposing specific ways in which such choices might be related. The models in these three classes are called random ranking and random utility, joint and sequential, and ratio scale. We include some models that belong to more than one class, with the best known being the maximum-difference (maxdiff) model, summarize estimation issues related to the models, and formulate a number of open theoretical problems.},

	abstract = {What types of human and social capital identify the emergence of leaders of open innovation communities? Consistent with the norms of an engineering culture, we find that future leaders must first make strong technical contributions. Beyond technical contributions, they must then integrate their communities in order to mobilize volunteers and avoid the ever-present danger of forking and balkanization. This is enabled by two correlated but distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary spanning between technological areas. An inherent lack of trust associated with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction. Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much more likely than brokers to advance to leadership. The research separates the influence of human and social capital on promotion, and highlights previously unexamined differences between brokerage- and boundary-spanning positions. Longitudinal analyses of careers within the Internet Engineering Task Force community from 1986–2002 support the arguments.},

We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts.},

Reports findings from research in progress investigating judgment and decision making during information seeking in the workplace, in particular, the assessment of enough information. Characteristics of this judgment and the role of context in shaping it are framed against theories of human judgment and decision making.  Method. Thirty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with public sector policy workers in Australia. Two interviews were carried out, the first with individual participants and the second, a joint interview with two participants. Interviews were taped and transcribed and inductive data analysis carried out. Findings.  Findings discussed in this paper focus on contextual factors that frame policy workers' judgment and   decision making while information seeking, factors including ill-structured problems, shifting goals, time stress and action-feedback loops. Also revealed was the importance of developing a framework, against which the judgment of enough information can be made, and the fluid and iterative nature of these judgments. Conclusion.  The contextual factors reported show similarities with those identified by naturalistic decision  making researchers, suggesting this new field of decision theory has much to offer researchers into information seeking in context.},

We report here on the research phase of a multi-stage dialogue examining convergences and divergences in how three fields (library and information science, human computer interaction and communication and media studies) looked at users and each other. Focus was on what researchers and practitioners saw as the big unanswered questions in user studies and what they saw as the convergences and divergences across disciplinary and practice-research divides. Method. Eighty-three international experts in the three fields were interviewed by phone; thirty-one local experts, public and academic librarians serving universities and colleges in central Ohio, were interviewed using self-journals and focus group reports. Analysis. A thematic analysis was completed. Purpose was not to fix substantive differences but to tap ways in which convergences and divergences showed relevance to the communicative aspects of the research enterprise. A theory of dialogue was applied that purposively positioned this analysis as only one of potentially many. Results.  All informants showed strong commitment to improving user studies and making them matter more to design, practice and society. At the same time, regardless of field or perspective, they struggled with the incoherencies of avalanches of user research. They decried the general inability to communicate across fields and between research and practice. They decried the ways in which structural conditions seemed to constrain possibilities. Yet, they hoped for making things better. Conclusions. The traditional modes used for communication in the social science research enterprise are not doing the job for user studies.

	abstract = {Progress in understanding the brain mechanisms underlying vision requires the construction of computational models that not only emulate the brain's anatomy and physiology, but ultimately match its performance on visual tasks. In recent years, “natural” images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled “natural” images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model—a neuroscientist's “null” model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks—outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a “simpler” recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition—real-world image variation.},

Here we show that it is also possible to generate text about the mental content reflected in brain images. We began with images collected as participants read names of concrete items (e.g., {“Apartment’’)} while also seeing line drawings of the item named. We built a model of the mental semantic representation of concrete concepts from text data and learned to map aspects of such representation to patterns of activation in the corresponding brain image. In order to validate this mapping, without accessing information about the items viewed for left-out individual brain images, we were able to generate from each one a collection of semantically pertinent words (e.g., “door,” “window” for {“Apartment’’).} Furthermore, we show that the ability to generate such words allows us to perform a classification task and thus validate our method quantitatively.},

While progress is being made in combating cyber crime (particularly with the Council of Europe's Convention on Cyber Crime), a large gap continues to exist in legislative compatibility across international borders. Often overlooked in regards to profiling is cyber crime. The idea that an individual committing crime in cyberspace can fit a certain outline (a profile) may seem far-fetched, but evidence suggests that certain distinguishing characteristics do regularly exist in cyber criminals. This can be particularly useful for companies (the most often hindered victims of cyber crime) attempting to do away with cyber criminals inside their own walls (the most common type of cyber criminals). Whether they are simply breaking company policy by browsing the Internet while on the clock or embezzling thousands of dollars through the company's network, insiders are a very real problem that companies spend millions of dollars annually to prevent. An accurate profile of an inside cyber criminal may help in identifying both prospectively and retrospectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Sentiments about vaccination can strongly affect individual vaccination decisions. Measuring such sentiments - and how they are distributed in a population - is typically a difficult and resource-intensive endeavor. We use publicly available data from Twitter, a popular online social media service, to measure the evolution and distribution of sentiments towards the novel influenza A({H1N1)} vaccine during the second half of 2009, i.e. the fall wave of the {H1N1} (swine flu) pandemic. We find that projected vaccination rates based on sentiments expressed on Twitter are in very good agreement with vaccination rates estimated by the {CDC} with traditional phone surveys. Looking at the online social network, we find that both negative and positive opinions are clustered, and that an equivalent level of clustering of vaccinations in a population would strongly increase disease outbreak risks.},

This paper examines the assumptions in different views of relevance, including “the system's view” and “the user's view” and offers a reinterpretation of these views. The paper finds that what was regarded as the most fundamental view by Saracevic in 1975 has not since been considered (with very few exceptions). Other views, which are based on less fruitful assumptions, have dominated the discourse on relevance in information retrieval and information science. Many authors have reexamined the concept of relevance in information science, but have neglected the subject knowledge view, hence basic theoretical assumptions seem not to have been properly addressed. It is as urgent now as it was in 1975 seriously to consider “the subject knowledge view” of relevance (which may also be termed “the epistemological view”). The concept of relevance, like other basic concepts, is influenced by overall approaches to information science, such as the cognitive view and the domain-analytic view. There is today a trend toward a social paradigm for information science. This paper offers an understanding of relevance from such a social point of view.},

We apply a mixed-initiative strategy that allows {ViA} and its users to share their different strengths and continually improve {ViA's} understanding of a user's preferences. We visualize historical weather conditions to compare {ViA's} search strategy to exhaustive analysis, simulated annealing, and reactive tabu search and to measure the improvement provided by mixed-initiative interaction. We also visualize intelligent agents competing in a simulated online auction to evaluate {ViA's} perceptual guidelines.

	abstract = {The Department of Defense ({DoD)} has come to rely on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf ({COTS)} acquisition as the primary means to introduce and upgrade computer technologies throughout the military. In adopting this approach, the personal computer ({PC)}, based on a commercial, business-model design, has become a de-facto standard. Within the thesis, this common, and widely-accepted desktop computer environment is defined as the {PC} Paradigm and encompasses the typical office-suite software, the information display, and the use of the desktop metaphor as the user-interface. The author contends that this near-exclusive reliance on {COTS} technologies is based on market-driven, commercial product solutions rather than a "domain specific" system design that is optimized to support intelligence analysis. The thesis addresses the following research question: Could the current personal computer environment (characterized as the {PC} Paradigm) function as an analysis inhibitor, rather than as a tool to facilitate analysis? Key findings suggested that a "paradigm conflict" exists between the needs of intelligence analysis and the commercial, office-based persona! computer employing the desktop metaphor as a user interface. Additionally, {COTS} technology acquisition, and its associated commercial standards, have appeared to supplant a design process optimized for the needs of the intelligence analyst. Such an approach disregards domain specificity in favor of a generalized, "one-size-fits-all" product solution. The thesis concludes that the {PC} Paradigm environment does contribute to inhibited analysis. The current paradigm is not derived from cognitive ergonomic requirements unique to intelligence analysis, nor does it support the analytic methodologies widely regarded as "best practices" within the field. The author contends that domain relevance is lacking in business-model tools when applied to the problems of intelligence analysis.},

	abstract = {Education in the health professions is placing greater emphasis on "active" learning-learning that requires applying knowledge to authentic problems; and that teaches students to engage in the kind of collaboration that is expected in today's clinical practice. Team-Based Learning ({TBL)} is a strategy that accomplishes these goals. It transforms passive, lecture-based coursework into an environment that promotes more self-directed learning and teamwork, and makes the classroom come "alive." This book is an introduction to {TBL} for health profession educators. It outlines the theory, structure, and process of {TBL}, explains how {TBL} promotes problem solving and critical thinking skills, aligns with the goals of science and health courses, improves knowledge retention and application, and develops students as professional practitioners. The book provides readers with models and guidance on everything they need to know about team formation and maintenance; peer feedback and evaluation processes, and facilitation; and includes a directory of tools and resources. The book includes chapters in which instructors describe how they apply {TBL} in their courses. The examples range across undergraduate science courses, basic and clinical sciences courses in medical, sports medicine and nursing education, residencies, and graduate nursing programs. The book concludes with a review and critique of the current scholarship on {TBL} in the health professions, and charts the needs for future research.},

We label this capability a firm's absorptive capacity and suggest that it is largely a function of the firm's level of prior related knowledge. The discussion focuses first on the cognitive basis for an individual's absorptive capacity including, in particular, prior related knowledge and diversity of background. We then characterize the factors that influence absorptive capacity at the organizational level, how an organization's absorptive capacity differs from that of its individual members, and the role of diversity of expertise within an organization. We argue that the development of absorptive capacity, and, in turn, innovative performance are history- or path-dependent and argue how lack of investment in an area of expertise early on may foreclose the future development of a technical capability in that area. We formulate a model of firm investment in research and development ({R\&D)}, in which {R\&D} contributes to a firm's absorptive capacity, and test predictions relating a firm's investment in {R\&D} to the knowledge underlying technical change within an industry. Discussion focuses on the implications of absorptive capacity for the analysis of other related innovative activities, including basic research, the adoption and diffusion of innovations, and decisions to participate in cooperative {R\&D} ventures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95\% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns.

	abstract = {Human subjects are extremely efficient at categorizing natural scenes, despite the fact that different classes of natural scenes often share similar image statistics. Thus far, however, it is unknown where and how complex natural scene categories are encoded and discriminated in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} and distributed pattern analysis to ask what regions of the brain can differentiate natural scene categories (such as forests vs mountains vs beaches). Using completely different exemplars of six natural scene categories for training and testing ensured that the classification algorithm was learning patterns associated with the category in general and not specific exemplars. We found that area V1, the parahippocampal place area ({PPA)}, retrosplenial cortex ({RSC)}, and lateral occipital complex ({LOC)} all contain information that distinguishes among natural scene categories. More importantly, correlations with human behavioral experiments suggest that the information present in the {PPA}, {RSC}, and {LOC} is likely to contribute to natural scene categorization by humans. Specifically, error patterns of predictions based on {fMRI} signals in these areas were significantly correlated with the behavioral errors of the subjects. Furthermore, both behavioral categorization performance and predictions from {PPA} exhibited a significant decrease in accuracy when scenes were presented up-down inverted. Together these results suggest that a network of regions, including the {PPA}, {RSC}, and {LOC}, contribute to the human ability to categorize natural scenes.},

In the presence of pervasive {ICT}, people are developing new practices for emergency response by using {ICT} to address problems that arise from information dearth and geographical dispersion. In doing so, they find community by reconnecting with others who share their concern for the locale threatened by the hazard.},

Patient self-reports were augmented by reports from collateral informants and by police and hospital records. The comparison group consisted of 519 people living in the neighborhoods in which the patients resided after hospital discharge. They were interviewed once about violence in the past 10 {weeks.Results}
There was no significant difference between the prevalence of violence by patients without symptoms of substance abuse and the prevalence of violence by others living in the same neighborhoods who were also without symptoms of substance abuse. Substance abuse symptoms significantly raised the rate of violence in both the patient and the comparison groups, and a higher portion of patients than of others in their neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse. Violence in both patient and comparison groups was most frequently targeted at family members and friends, and most often took place at {home.Conclusions}
{"Discharged} mental patients" do not form a homogeneous group in relation to violence in the community. The prevalence of community violence by people discharged from acute psychiatric facilities varies considerably according to diagnosis and, particularly, co-occurring substance abuse diagnosis or symptoms.},

However, whilst the nature of the best–worst task is generally understood, there are a number of issues relating to the design and analysis of a best–worst choice experiment that require further exposition. This paper illustrates how to aggregate and analyse such data and using a quality of life pilot study demonstrates how richer insights can be drawn by the use of best–worst tasks.},

It questions the view that tacit knowledge transfer is confined to local milieus whereas codified knowledge may roam the globe almost frictionlessly. The paper highlights the conditions under which both tacit and codified knowledge can be exchanged locally and globally. A distinction is made between, on the one hand, the learning processes taking place among actors embedded in a community by just being there dubbed buzz and, on the other, the knowledge attained by investing in building channels of communication called pipelines to selected providers located outside the local milieu. It is argued that the co-existence of high levels of buzz and many pipelines may provide firms located in outward-looking and lively clusters with a string of particular advantages not available to outsiders. Finally, some policy implications, stemming from this argument, are identified.},

Homelessness, health care, and crime are all viewed as problems that networks can manage better than single organizations can. This article views these problems as networks that must be confronted if Western democracies wish to deal with terrorism, drug smuggling, and the manifold pathologies that confront failed states. In this article we adopt the perspective of networks as {problems.The} majority of the literature on networks and collaboration is quite positive. Collaborative networks are seen as appropriate devices to tackle public management problems and successfully coordinate political, social, and economic action. From the level of global governance, European integration, sectoral policy networks at the national level, and service implementation networks at the local level, these devices are all viewed as ways of solving governance problems in a complex and differentiated world. The research proposed here intends to develop a more holistic view of this phenomenon by looking at dark networks. The article tries to evaluate how network structures and governance are used for criminal or immoral ends. Because the judgment of ends is inherently normative, we propose to talk about overt and legal versus covert and illegal networks. We then analyze where the similarities and differences between the two sets are and what we might be able to learn regarding both forms if we mirror them against each other. The article develops a set of propositions drawn from selected cases of drug‐trafficking networks, the diamond and weapons trade, and the Al Qaeda terrorist network.},

	url = {http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA523503},
	abstract = {The proliferation of data accessibility has exacerbated the risk of shallowness in information analysis, making it increasingly difficult to tell when analysis is sufficient for making decisions or changing plans, even as it becomes increasingly easy to find seemingly relevant data. In addressing the risk of shallow analysis, the concept of rigor emerges as an approach for coping with this fundamental uncertainty-motivating the need to better define and understand analytical rigor. The concept of rigor is explored in this thesis through a study that asks how professional analysts decide when there is sufficient rigor in an analytic process. Nine professional intelligence analysts participated in a scenario walkthrough in which they critiqued the analysis processes of two junior analysts-one representing a high-rigor analysis process and the other a low-rigor process. In the study, participants assumed the role of analyst supervisor, deciding if these analyses were of sufficient rigor to send to a decision maker-a fundamental judgment task characterized as the Supervisor's Dilemma. This study design validated and refined the Elicitation by Critiquing methodology, also developing the Liquified Natural Gas Scenario, based on security issues that challenge safety analyses, as a cognitive case for exploring themes in information analysis. This research identified three general findings on rigor in information analysis. First, it found that process insight influenced judgments of rigor. Second, it found that while similar cues were used in forming assessments of rigor, the way in which those cues were interpreted as indicating rigor tended to be more varied. Third, the results of the study suggest a revised definition of analytical rigor, reframing it as an emergent multi-attribute measure of sufficiency rather than as a measure of process deviation.},

We carried out two {PET} studies to determine whether there is any regional specialization for the processing of nouns and verbs. One study used the lexical decision task and the other used a more semantically demanding task, i.e. semantic categorization. We found robust activation of a semantic network extending from left inferior frontal cortex into the inferior temporal lobe, but no differences as a function of word class. We interpret these data within the framework of cognitive accounts in which conceptual knowledge is represented within a non-differentiated distributed system.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes various techniques to perform attribution of computer attackers who are exploiting data networks. Attribution can be defined as determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary. In the public literature "traceback" or "source tracking" are often used as terms instead of "attribution." This paper is intended for use by the {U.S.} Department of Defense ({DoD)} as it considers if it should improve its attribution capability, and if so, how to do so. However, since the focus of this paper is on technology, it may also be of use to many others such as law enforcement personnel. This is a technical report, and assumes that the reader understands the basics of network technology, especially the Transmission Control {Protocol/Internet} Protocol ({TCP/IP)} suite of protocols.},

Here, we examine a group on a popular social networking site as a virtual destination in the aftermath of the Northern Illinois University ({NIU)} shootings of February 14, 2008 in relation to related activity that happened in response to the Virginia Tech ({VT)} tragedy 10 months earlier. We consider features of interactions that are enabled when a vast audience converges under such conditions. We discuss how commiseration and information seeking are interrelated, and how geographical communities that share a common experience ally in such a public, online setting.},

We apply Social Network Analysis ({SNA)} to analyse the communication patterns and relationships between members of the discussion board. In addition to looking at the structure of the exchanged messages within the discussion board as a whole, we also investigate associations between the communication content and the social network patterns. Our findings show distinct differences between the social network patterns of empathic and non-empathic communications. For example, members are more connected and closer to each other in the social networks that are based on empathic communication compared to non-empathic communication. Additionally our results show that the type of empathic communication (e.g. different kinds of support) is linked to the social network structure within the discussion board.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-12-124},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Dengue is the most common arboviral disease of humans, with more than one third of the world's population at risk. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks may lead to public health interventions that mitigate the effect of the disease. Predicting infectious disease outbreaks is a challenging task; truly predictive methods are still in their infancy.
{METHODS:} We describe a novel prediction method utilizing Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to extract relationships between clinical, meteorological, climatic, and socio-political data from Peru. These relationships are in the form of rules. The best set of rules is automatically chosen and forms a classifier. That classifier is then used to predict future dengue incidence as either {HIGH} (outbreak) or {LOW} (no outbreak), where these values are defined as being above and below the mean previous dengue incidence plus two standard deviations, respectively.
{RESULTS:} Our automated method built three different fuzzy association rule models. Using the first two weekly models, we predicted dengue incidence three and four weeks in advance, respectively. The third prediction encompassed a four-week period, specifically four to seven weeks from time of prediction. Using previously unused test data for the period 4-7 weeks from time of prediction yielded a positive predictive value of 0.686, a negative predictive value of 0.976, a sensitivity of 0.615, and a specificity of 0.982.
{CONCLUSIONS:} We have developed a novel approach for dengue outbreak prediction. The method is general, could be extended for use in any geographical region, and has the potential to be extended to other environmentally influenced infections. The variables used in our method are widely available for most, if not all countries, enhancing the generalizability of our method.},

In the 23 attacks, there was evidence of psychotic illness at the time in 11 (48\%) cases, with evidence of mental disorder in 4 additional ones. These data almost certainly underestimate the contribution of major mental disorder, as psychiatric evaluations were not available on several attackers. Psychotic states do not, however, preclude a rational element to the attackers' grievances. The objective of most attackers was to commit an outrageous act to bring attention to grievances. Nine attackers had stalked their victims. Greater attention to psychiatric disorder among those who harass royalty or other public figures would allow early intervention. Ensuring that the obviously mentally ill stalkers of prominent persons are referred to psychiatric services would meet the needs of most of them for treatment and care, while reducing the chances that a tiny minority will progress to attack.},

	abstract = {The history and background of the analysis of the basis of power is examined, beginning with its origins in the works of Kurt Lewin and his followers at the Research Center for Group Dynamics, particularly the early research by John R. P. French. The original French and Raven (1959) bases of power model posited six bases of power: reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, referent, and informational (or persuasion; Raven, 1965), Since then, as the result of considerable research, the model has gone through significant developments. A more comprehensive model is presented here that reviews the following: various motivations of the influencing agent; an assessment of available power bases in terms of potential effectiveness, time perspective, personal preferences, values and norms; consideration of other strategies such as manipulation; utilization of various preparatory and stage-setting devices to strengthen one's power resources; implementation of the power strategies; assessment of effectiveness of influence attempt and its positive and/or negative aftereffects; use of various ameliorative devices; and review, reconsideration, and another round of influence strategies. The overall model is examined in terms of its applicability to various settings including hospital infection control, patient compliance with physicians' recommendations, confrontations between political figures, children's influence on their peers, conflict resolution and negotiation, as well as supervisor/subordinate relationships.},

Rather than focusing on the content of speech, the current approach examines the style of language use through people's use of function words (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, articles). By calculating the degree to which individuals and groups use function words across a wide variety of texts, it is possible to determine when groups are most prone to engage in violence. The current project analyzed 296 speeches, interviews, and articles from members of four extremist Arabic-speaking groups, two of which have a history of violent attacks, using a computerized text analysis program that calculated the percentage of total words that reflected different function word categories. Overall, each group had its own distinctive language style that reflected, in essence, its own personality. In the month preceding and following violent acts, both terrorist groups changed in their language use in ways that suggested less divergent thinking and cognitive complexity. In the 2-6 months prior to the attacks, the two violent groups evidenced different language patterns that were predictive of later attacks.},

Based on a sample of 145 homeless young adults in the Midwestern United States, results revealed that having used alcohol with at least one of their network members and the presence of more conflict was associated with engaging in a greater number of sexual risk taking behaviors. Correlates of engaging in a greater number of substance use related behaviors included having older peers within the network, having used illicit drugs with at least one network member, and the presence of more conflict. The presence of a family member in one's network, however, was associated with fewer sexual and drug related risk behaviors. Overall, the social network characteristics of youth explained significant, additional variance beyond that of youth's own characteristics and their early family histories.},

	abstract = {Many authors have stressed the existence of continuous processes of convergence and divergence, stability and instability, evolution and revolution in every organization. This article argues that these processes are embedded in organizational characteristics and in the way organizations are managed. Organizations are presented as nonlinear dynamic systems subject to forces of stability and forces of instability which push them toward chaos. When in a chaotic domain, organizations are likely to exhibit the qualitative properties of chaotic systems. Several of these properties-sensitivity to initial conditions, discreteness of change, attraction to specific configurations, structural invariance at different scales and irreversibility-are used to establish six propositions. First, because of the coupling of counteracting forces, organizations are potentially chaotic. Second, the path from organizational stability to chaos follows a discrete process of change. Third, when the organization is in the chaotic domain, small changes can have big consequences that cannot be predicted in the long term. Fourth, from chaos, new stabilities emerge -the strange attractors-which are assimilated to organizational configurations. Fifth, similar patterns should be found at different scales. Finally, during one single organizational life span or between two different organizations similar actions should never lead to the same result.},

This evidence comes from a 1998 survey of 39,211 visitors to the National Geographic Society Web site, one of the first large-scale Web surveys. The authors find that people's interaction online supplements their face-to-face and telephone communication without increasing or decreasing it. However, heavy Internet use is associated with increased participation in voluntary organizations and politics. Further support for this effect is the positive association between offline and online participation in voluntary organizations and politics. However, the effects of the Internet are not only positive: The heaviest users of the Internet are the least committed to online community. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the Internet is becoming normalized as it is incorporated into the routine practices of everyday life.},

The sampling procedure is described, in which queries obtained from each library were broadly categorised by image content, identification and accessibility. Attention is focused on the image content requests, for which a categorisation based on facet analysis is developed. The analytical tool which is used for this purpose is based on a schema already well established for the analysis of levels of meaning in images. The project demonstrates the possibility of formulating a general categorisation of requests which seek widely different still and moving image material. The paper concludes with observations on the potential value of embedding such a schema within the user interface of unmediated-query visual information retrieval systems.},

It is argued that individuals form beliefs about their use of information technologies within a broad milieu of influences emanating from the individual, institutional, and social contexts in which they interact with {IT.} We examine the simultaneous effects of these three sets of influences on beliefs about usefulness and ease of use in the context of a contemporary technology targeted at autonomous knowledge workers. Our findings suggest that beliefs about technology use can be influenced by top management commitment to new technology and the individual factors of personal innovativeness and self-efficacy. Surprisingly, social influences from multiple sources exhibited no significant effects. Theoretical and practical implications are offered.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0902},
	abstract = {Network structures are extremely important to the study of political science. Much of the data in its subfields are naturally represented as networks. This includes trade, diplomatic and conflict relationships. The social structure of several organization is also of interest to many researchers, such as the affiliations of legislators or the relationships among terrorist. A key aspect of studying social networks is understanding the evolutionary dynamics and the mechanism by which these structures grow and change over time. While current methods are well suited to describe static features of networks, they are less capable of specifying models of change and simulating network evolution. In the following paper I present a new method for modeling network growth and evolution. This method relies on graph motifs to generate simulated network data with particular structural characteristic. This technique departs notably from current methods both in form and function. Rather than a closed-form model, or stochastic implementation from a single class of graphs, the proposed "graph motif model" provides a framework for building flexible and complex models of network evolution. The paper proceeds as follows: first a brief review of the current literature on network modeling is provided to place the graph motif model in context. Next, the graph motif model is introduced, and a simple example is provided. As a proof of concept, three classic random graph models are recovered using the graph motif modeling method: the Erdos-Renyi binomial random graph, the Watts-Strogatz "small world" model, and the Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model. In the final section I discuss the results of these simulations and subsequent advantage and disadvantages presented by using this technique to model social networks.},

The data is independent of any particular image retrieval algorithm and can be used to evaluate and compare many such algorithms without further data collection. The data and calibration software are available on-line. We develop and validate methods for generating sensible evaluation data, calibrating for disparate evaluators, mapping image retrieval system scores to the human evaluation results, and comparing retrieval systems.

	abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or publish the information, observing individual transmissions (who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is {NP-hard} to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.},

This study makes two essential contributions for interpreting emerging temporal trends in these information systems. First, based on a large dataset of Twitter messages from one geographic area, we develop a taxonomy of the trends present in the data. Second, we identify important dimensions according to which trends can be categorized, as well as the key distinguishing features of trends that can be derived from their associated messages. We quantitatively examine the computed features for different categories of trends, and establish that significant differences can be detected across categories. Our study advances the understanding of trends on Twitter and other social awareness streams, which will enable powerful applications and activities, including user-driven real-time information services for local communities.},

Recent research that has applied social learning theory to account for the problem of cybercrime and deviance has provided only partial examinations of the social learning process and gives little insight into the Social Structure and Social Learning ({SSSL)} model. This study uses structural equation modeling to assess the full social learning process and finds social learning to be a second-order latent construct that explains a large variation in cyber-deviance, in addition, the social learning process mediates the effects of race and sex on cyber-deviance. We conclude with further implications for research on both eyber-deviance and the {SSSL} model.},

	abstract = {Affective dysfunction is a defining schizotypy feature; yet the majority of studies examining affective dysfunction have largely relied on self-report of trait affect, which reflects only one dimension of emotional experience. Emerging research has explored a second dimension, state affect, using laboratory manipulation, with most finding that schizotypal participants report experiencing less positive/more negative affect than controls. This study expands upon this topic by examining patterns of state affect in psychometrically identified schizotypy through self-report and lexical expression in reaction to emotionally valenced photos. Overall, the schizotypy group reported less positive/more negative affect across affect induction conditions. Both schizotypy and control groups' affect ratings were similar following the unpleasant stimuli; but the schizotypy group's ratings remained significantly less positive/more negative than the control group following the pleasant stimuli. This pattern suggests that the schizotypy group experienced a deficit in emotional reactivity compared to controls in pleasant situations. The schizotypy group also used a higher percentage of negative words and a lower percentage of positive words in vocalized reactions during the pleasant, but not unpleasant, affect induction condition. These results reveal a specific pattern of “in-the-moment” affective dysfunction unique to pleasant situations that is consistent across both subjective experience and lexical expression.},

However such explanations do not take account of the central role that individuals play in the knowledge transfer process, specifically in articulating and legitimizing the knowledge base and in shaping and interpreting the organizational context. This article examines the merger process as experienced within six accounting and consulting firms. It finds that professionals resist knowledge transfer when they perceive that the merging firms differ fundamentally in terms of the quality of their external image and the form of their knowledge base. Whilst professionals may attribute their resistance to commercial and objective concerns, their responses are also governed by highly personal and subjective factors. This study identifies this complex combination of factors as the twin fears of exploitation and contamination.},

With the buzz surrounding the service have come claims of its ability to transform the way people interact and share information and calls for public figures to start using the service. In this study, we are interested in the type of content that legislators are posting to the service, particularly by members of the United States Congress. We read and analyzed the content of over 6,000 posts from all members of Congress using the site. Our analysis shows that Congresspeople are primarily using Twitter to disperse information, particularly links to news articles about themselves and to their blog posts, and to report on their daily activities. These tend not to provide new insights into government or the legislative process or to improve transparency; rather, they are vehicles for self-promotion. However, Twitter is also facilitating direct communication between Congresspeople and citizens, though this is a less popular activity. We report on our findings and analysis and discuss other uses of Twitter for legislators.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to address the problem of how to transfer expertise between generations of Naval intelligence analysts. Expertise refers to the tacit and explicit knowledge that senior analysts call upon to perform intelligence analysis. Transfer refers to the process of "passing on" knowledge from senior analysts to those who will replace them. Transfer also refers to adaptive expertise where a new generation of analysts apply their freshly-learned knowledge in flexible and creative ways. Lessons are drawn from the literature on knowledge management, the science of learning, human information processing, and experience from selected knowledge preservation projects in government organizations. These lessons are used to construct a model of knowledge preservation, building on a simplified model of knowledge transfer derived from the concepts of logical depth and exformation. A three-pronged model, based on how long senior analysts are available to work face-to-face with their replacements, emerges from this approach. A case is made to adopt a story-centered approach to learning. Ideas for putting this model into action at the Office of Naval Intelligence are presented. The practical issues of cost, schedule, and cultural acceptance are addressed.},

	abstract = {Knowledge sharing within and between teams is of vital importance for organizations. The influence of interpersonal trust in general and trust in management in particular on knowledge sharing is evident. However, it is not clear how the relationship between interpersonal trust and knowledge sharing works. This study provides a better understanding of that relationship by demonstrating that fear of losing one's unique value and knowledge documentation have a mediating effect on the relationship between trust in management and knowledge sharing. Specifically, trust in management increases knowledge sharing through reducing fear of losing one's unique value and improving willingness to document knowledge. These findings have important implications at both a managerial and theoretical level. For managers, this paper emphasizes the individual's central role in the knowledge sharing process in terms of knowledge documentation and fear of losing one's unique value. On the theoretical level, this study provides empirical evidence for two mechanisms that help explain the effect of trust in management on knowledge sharing. In future research, this study could be extended to include other psychosocial phenomena that enable knowledge sharing in organizations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., "subtle nuances") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., "very cavalier"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "excellent" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "poor". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74\% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84\% for automobile reviews to 66\% for movie reviews.},

In the study of expertise, whether in the context of applications or the context of psychological research, knowledge elicitation is a crucial step. Research in a number of traditions - judgment and decision making, human factors, cognitive science, expert systems - has utilized a variety of knowledge elicitation methods. Given the diversity of disciplines, topics, paradigms, and goals, it is difficult to make the literature cohere around a methodological theme. For discussion purposes, we place knowledge elicitation techniques into three categories: (1) analysis of the tasks that experts usually perform, (2) various types of interviews, and (3) contrived tasks which reveal an expert's reasoning processes without necessarily asking about these processes. We illustrate types and subtypes of techniques, culminating in a discussion of research that has empirically evaluated and compared techniques. The article includes some recommendations about "how to do" knowledge elicitation, some cautionary tales, and a discussion of the prospects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Building on earlier work (Burt and Knez 1995; Burt 1999a), my argument is framed with respect to two hypotheses describing how closure affects the flow of information in a network. What I will discuss as a bandwidth hypothesis presumed in closure models of social capital and in related work such as reputation models in economics says that network closure enhances information flow. The echo hypothesis based on the social psychology of selective disclosure in informal conversations says that closed networks do not enhance information flow so much as they create an echo that reinforces predispositions. Information obtained in casual conversations is more redundant than personal experience but not properly discounted, which creates an erroneous sense of certainty. Interpersonal evaluations are amplified to positive and negative extremes. Favorable opinion is amplified into trust. Doubt is amplified into distrust. In Section 1, I summarize as a baseline model the dyadic exchange theory of trust production that ignores social context. Bandwidth and echo hypotheses are introduced in Section 2 as contextual extensions of the baseline. In Section 3, I use network data on three study populations to illustrate contradiction between the hypotheses and empirical support for echo over bandwidth. My summary conclusion in Section 4 is that network closure does not facilitate trust so  Bandwidth and Echo, Page 3  much as it amplifies predispositions, creating a structural arthritis in which people cannot learn what they do not already know. 1. {TRUST} {WITHOUT} {CONTEXT:} {BASELINE} {HYPOTHESIS}  Take as the unit of analysis the relat...},

	abstract = {Pervasive infrastructures, such as cell phone networks, enable to capture large amounts of human behavioral data but also provide information about the structure of cities and their dynamical properties. In this article, we focus on these last aspects by studying phone data recorded during 55 days in 31 Spanish metropolitan areas. We first define an urban dilatation index which measures how the average distance between individuals evolves during the day, allowing us to highlight different types of city structure. We then focus on hotspots, the most crowded places in the city. We propose a parameter free method to detect them and to test the robustness of our results. The number of these hotspots scales sublinearly with the population size, a result in agreement with previous theoretical arguments and measures on employment datasets. We study the lifetime of these hotspots and show in particular that the hierarchy of permanent ones, which constitute the "heart" of the city, is very stable whatever the size of the city. The spatial structure of these hotspots is also of interest and allows us to distinguish different categories of cities, from monocentric and "segregated" where the spatial distribution is very dependent on land use, to polycentric where the spatial mixing between land uses is much more important. These results point towards the possibility of a new, quantitative classification of cities using high resolution spatio-temporal data.},

Given the difficulty of the latter, the prospects for automatic image tagging do not appear promising. A brief survey of the current state of the art confirms that conclusion. Then the paper discusses an effort to tag images based on nonpixel data and proceeds with the outline of a case where the difficulty of automatic tagging is taken advantage to construct image based {CAPTCHA} to distinguish human users from Web-bots. That has led to certain interesting approaches to achieve reliable human tagging that is needed for the {CAPTCHA} application.},

We propose methods to integrate topical and social information and behavior derived from social media to improve situational understanding during an extreme event.  Using Twitter data from the 2011 London riots, we analyze emergent social networks directly relating to response to crisis.  We construct social networks from these tweets based on talking to (directed communication), quoting (retweeting), and talking about (mentioning) behaviors. We examine networks of riot response oriented around cleanup or prayer activities.  These networks differ in size, structure, and membership. We identify prominent network actors and assess their similarity. These methods may enable more effective response during disasters or other emergency events.},

In 1985, the General Social Survey ({GSS)} collected the first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 {GSS} the authors replicated those questions to assess social change in core network structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the {U.S.} population. Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates, but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in America.},

We consider two competing theories about the linkage of contexts with motives for identity change: the effect of category traits, based on social identity theory, and the effect of social networks, based on identity theory. To explore these relations, we use data collected on more than 6,000 adolescents at six high schools in two consecutive school years. Multilevel logit models reveal a strong relationship between contexts and perceived identity imbalances, and a strong effect of identity imbalance on identity change. More important than category traits are the social network characteristics of prominence, homogeneity, and bridging; these form social contexts that affect perceptions of identity imbalance, and the perceptions in turn lead to a heightened incidence of identity change.},

This article contrasts two empirical accounts of social influence (structural cohesion and equivalence) and describes the social processes (e.g., identification, competition, and authority) presumed to undergird them. It then reviews mathematical models of influence processes involving networks and related statistical models used in data analysis. Particular attention is given to the “network effects” model. A number of empirical studies of social influence are reviewed. The article concludes by identifying several problems of specification, research design, and measurement and suggesting some research that would help to resolve these problems.},

	abstract = {The ways people use words can reveal a great deal about their personalities, intentions, and social relationships. Rather than focusing on the content of speech, the current approach examines the style of language use through people's use of function words (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, articles). By calculating the degree to which individuals and groups use function words across a wide variety of texts, it is possible to determine when groups are most prone to engage in violence. The current project analyzed 296 speeches, interviews, and articles from members of four extremist Arabic-speaking groups, two of which have a history of violent attacks, using a computerized text analysis program that calculated the percentage of total words that reflected different function word categories. Overall, each group had its own distinctive language style that reflected, in essence, its own personality. In the month preceding and following violent acts, both terrorist groups changed in their language use in ways that suggested less divergent thinking and cognitive complexity. In the 2-6 months prior to the attacks, the two violent groups evidenced different language patterns that were predictive of later attacks.},

	abstract = {A large number of digital images are available and accessible due to recent advances in technology. Since image retrieval systems are designed to meet user information needs, it seems apparent that image retrieval system design and implementation should take into account user-based aspects such as information use patterns and relevance judgments. However, little is known about what criteria users employ when making relevance judgments and which textual representations of the image help them make relevance judgments in their situational context.

Thus, this study attempted to investigate the criteria which image users apply when making judgments about the relevance of an image. This research was built on prior work by Barry, Schamber and others which examined relevance criteria for textual and non-textual documents, exploring the extent to which these criteria apply to visual documents and the extent to which new and different criteria apply. Data were collected from unstructured interviews and questionnaires. Quantitative statistical methods were employed to analyze the importance of relevance criteria to see how much each criterion affected the user's judgments. The study involved 38 faculty and graduate students of American history in 1999 in a local setting, using the Library of Congress American memory photo archives.

The study found that the user's perception of topicality was still the most important factor across the information-seeking stages. However, the users decided on retrieved items according to a variety of criteria other than topicality. Image quality and clarity was important. Users also searched for relevant images on the basis of title, date, subject descriptors, and notes provided. The conclusions of this study will be useful in image database design to assist users in conducting image searches. This study can be helpful to future relevance studies in information system design and evaluation.},

The purpose of our study is to determine what types of information are shared by city police departments over Twitter and to determine how the public uses the information shared to converse with the police departments and with each other. We read and analyzed 4,915 posts authored by 30 city police departments that have active Twitter accounts. The analysis shows that city police departments in large {U.S.} cities primarily use Twitter to disseminate crime and incident related information. City police departments also use Twitter to share information about their departments, events, traffic, safety awareness, and crime prevention. To a lesser extent, city police departments use Twitter to converse directly with the public and news media. We also sampled four weeks of public-authored tweets, totaling 1,984 tweets, that contained police department Twitter usernames and found that a majority of these tweets were retweets of police authored tweets; public-authored tweets also mentioned police departments in discussions or were used to send direct messages. This paper furthers our understanding of information sharing by city police departments as well as public redistribution of this information through the use of social media tools.},

The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It identifies three different connotative meanings that have been assigned to the social support construct, and describes their empirical operationalizations in several recent studies. Specifically, the social integration/participation formulation, the social network approach, and the social intimacy measurement strategy are described and contrasted. Within the latter approach, one study that illuminated types of informal helping behaviors is discussed in greater detail. A review of possible mechanisms whereby social support accom plishes its health-protective impact is also offered, and two types of planned interventions involving the mobilization or optimization of social support are spotlighted. The article concludes with ideas about ways that professionals can safeguard the natural helping skills of citizens and achieve an appropriate balance between formal and informal systems of service delivery in the health and human services fields.},

To assess the relative importance of these features, we experimentally examine behavior in a game with incomplete contracts. Our main results are that mere repeated interaction with the same player increased effort levels as compared to one-shot interactions. Social approval incentives were not very important in our experiments. Reciprocal behavior clearly was the dominant pattern. Most of it was intrinsic reciprocity, i.e., neither repeated play nor approval incentives influenced the extent of reciprocity very much.

The results show that failed image queries have a much higher specificity than successful queries because users often employ various refined types to specify their queries. The study explores the refined types further, and finds that failed queries consist of far more conceptual than perceptual refined types. The widely used content-based image retrieval technique, {CBIR}, can only deal with a small proportion of failed queries; hence, appropriate integration of concept-based techniques is desirable. Based on using the concepts of uniqueness and refinement for categorization, the study also provides a useful discussion on the gaps between image queries and retrieval techniques. The initial results enhance the understanding of failed queries and suggest possible ways to improve image retrieval systems.},

Brain imaging studies have shown that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of pictures and words (for example, tools, buildings, and animals). We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} neural activation associated with words for which {fMRI} data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed {fMRI} data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts {fMRI} activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have {fMRI} data.},

Drawing on British examples, we argue that whereas over the past 40 years sociologists championed innovative methodological resources, notably the sample survey and the in-depth interviews, which reasonably allowed them to claim distinctive expertise to access the `social' in powerful ways, such claims are now much less secure. We argue that both the sample survey and the in-depth interview are increasingly dated research methods, which are unlikely to provide a robust base for the jurisdiction of empirical sociologists in coming decades. We conclude by speculating how sociology might respond to this coming crisis through taking up new interests in the `politics of method'.},

	abstract = {Social media is a place where users present themselves to the world, revealing personal details and insights into their lives. We are beginning to understand how some of this information can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with interfaces and with one another. In this paper, we are interested in the personality of users. Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions; it has been shown to be useful in predicting job satisfaction, professional and romantic relationship success, and even preference for different interfaces. Until now, to accurately gauge users' personalities, they needed to take a personality test. This made it impractical to use personality analysis in many social media domains. In this paper, we present a method by which a user's personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Facebook profile. We will describe the type of data collected, our methods of analysis, and the results of predicting personality traits through machine learning. We then discuss the implications this has for social media design, interface design, and broader domains.},

	abstract = {This paper examines microblogging information diffusion activity during the 2011 Egyptian political uprisings. Specifically, we examine the use of the retweet mechanism on Twitter, using empirical evidence of information propagation to reveal aspects of work that the crowd conducts. Analysis of the widespread contagion of a popular meme reveals interaction between those who were "on the ground" in Cairo and those who were not. However, differences between information that appeals to the larger crowd and those who were doing on-the-ground work reveal important interplay between the two realms. Through both qualitative and statistical description, we show how the crowd expresses solidarity and does the work of information processing through recommendation and filtering. We discuss how these aspects of work mutually sustain crowd interaction in a politically sensitive context. In addition, we show how features of this retweet-recommendation behavior could be used in combination with other indicators to identify information that is new and likely coming from the ground.},

Managers sort relations on two dimensions of strength - intimacy (especially close versus distant) versus activity (frequent contact with new acquaintances versus rare contact with old friends) - and with respect to two contents - personal discussion (confiding and socializing relations) versus corporate authority (the formal authority of the boss and informal authority of essential buy-in). Comparing name generators for their construct validity as indicators of social capital, I compute network constraint from different kinds of relations, and correlate constraint with early promotion. The correlation is strong for the network of personal relations, zero for the network of authority relations, and strongest for personal and authority relations together. I close with research design recommendations for selecting name generators.},

The general process often requires multiple transformation steps before a final visual representation is generated. This article characterizes the complex raw data to be analyzed and then describes two different sets of transformations and representations. The first set transforms the raw data into more concise representations that improve the performance of sophisticated computational methods. The second transforms internal representations into visual representations that provide the most benefit to an interactive user. The end result is a computing system that enhances an end user's analytic process with effective visual representations and interactive techniques. While progress has been made on improving data transformations and representations, there is substantial room for improvement.},

Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and {safe.Like} defining works from the past, such as The Lonely Crowd and The Affluent Society, and like the works of C.

	abstract = {Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast brief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of contacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the launch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing, and news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended use, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author's mood status. As such, tweets can be regarded as temporally-authentic microscopic instantiations of public mood state. In this article, we perform a sentiment analysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and December 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of mood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended version of the Profile of Mood States ({POMS)}, a well-established psychometric instrument. We compare our results to fluctuations recorded by stock market and crude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as the {U.S.} Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.},

Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients’ social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption.},

The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult.

Our algorithm leverages users practice of adding tags to some messages by bootstrapping over virtual non sparse documents. We experiment on a large corpus of tweets from Twitter, and evaluate results against a gold-standard classification validated by seven clustering evaluation measures (information theoretic, paired and greedy). Results show that the algorithm presented is both accurate and efficient, significantly outperforming other algorithms. Under reasonable practical assumptions, our algorithm scales up sublinearly in time.},

	abstract = {This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser. The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75\% F-measure, a 13\% relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2\%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing ({NLP)}, the approach should be applicable to many other {NLP} problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation.},

	abstract = {Today, more and more data is becoming available on the Web. In particular, we have recently witnessed an exponential increase of multimedia content within various content sharing websites. While this content is widely available, great challenges have arisen to effectively search and browse such vast amount of content. A solution to this problem is to annotate information, a task that without computer aid requires a large-scale human effort. The goal of this thesis is to automate the task of annotating multimedia information with machine learning algorithms.
We propose the development of a machine learning framework capable of doing automated image annotation in large-scale consumer photos. To this extent a study on state of art algorithms was conducted, which concluded with a baseline implementation of a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. This baseline was used to implement a more advanced algorithm capable of annotating images in the situations with limited training images and a large set of test images – thus, a semi-supervised approach.
Further studies were conducted on the feature spaces used to describe images towards a successful integration in the developed framework. We first analyzed the semantic gap between the visual feature spaces and concepts present in an image, and how to avoid or mitigate this gap. Moreover, we examined how users perceive images by performing a statistical analysis of the image tags inserted by users. A linguistic and statistical expansion of image tags was also implemented.
The developed framework withstands uneven data distributions that occur in consumer datasets, and scales accordingly, requiring few previously annotated data. The principal mechanism that allows easier scaling is the propagation of information between the annotated data and un-annotated data.},

By harnessing the low-level human visual system, we can support our dual goals of rapid and accurate visualization. Perceptual guidelines that we have built using psychophysical experiments form the basis for {ViA.} {ViA} uses modified mixed-initiative planning algorithms from artificial intelligence to search of perceptually optical data attribute to visual feature mappings. Our perceptual guidelines are integrated into evaluation engines that provide evaluation weights for a given data-feature mapping, and hints on how that mapping might be improved. {ViA} begins by asking users a set of simple questions about their dataset and the analysis tasks they want to perform. Answers to these questions are used in combination with the evaluation engines to identify and intelligently pursue promising data-feature mappings. The result is an automatically-generated set of mappings that are perceptually salient, but that also respect the context of the dataset and users' preferences about how they want to visualize their data.},

	abstract = {In order to study the use of Twitter, it would be useful to be able to easily classify large volumes of messaging being used by Twitter users besides just in the traditional dimensions of positive and negative sentiment. For instance, in the space of social media marketing, it would be useful to be able to automatically identify social media messages into the classic framework of informative, persuasive and transformative advertising. In this paper we propose a general method for using crowdsourced training data labels for supervised machine learning, in order to automatically classify social media messaging with multidimensional sentiment analysis. We proceed with our methodology to create classifiers in the context of a firm’s messaging, but we hypothesize that its applications are more general than this context. Our results show that the proposed method works for the relatively objective attribute of informativeness, but is not as useful for more subjective attributes such as persuasiveness and transformativeness. We finish by discussing recommendations for future work in this area.},

We hypothesize that the immigrant's activism in cultivating social networks in the receiving society, and hardiness in the personality repertoire, are the chief means of ameliorating strain. Also examined are issues related to (1) the nature of social networks, (2) ties to the immigrant community and to the host society, and (3) how these ties influence adaptation.},

A greater understanding of this relationship may complement existing security practices by possibly highlighting new areas for safeguard implementation. To help facilitate a greater understanding of the offender/environment dynamic, this paper, therefore, aims to assess the feasibility of applying three criminological theories to the {IS} security context. Rather than focusing on why people become criminals, these theories entitled routine activity theory, environmental criminology and the rational choice perspective, focus on the criminal act. Analysis indicates support for the concepts central to environmental criminology and the rational choice perspective. While case study evidence supports two of the concepts advanced by routine activity theory, as a whole the theory is found wanting, as the "guardianship" and "handled offender" concepts appear to lack the necessary sophistication to theoretically accommodate and explain supervisory and control failings cited in the case study. Greater knowledge of the offender/context dynamic may feasibly enhance existing security practices by possibly highlighting new areas for safeguard implementation.},

	abstract = {The chronic widespread misuse of statistics is usually inadvertent, not intentional. We find cautionary examples in a series of recent papers by Christakis and Fowler that advance statistical arguments for the transmission via social networks of various personal characteristics, including obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, and loneliness. Those papers also assert that such influence extends to three degrees of separation in social networks. We shall show that these conclusions do not follow from Christakis and Fowler's statistical analyses. In fact, their studies even provide some evidence against the existence of such transmission. The errors that we expose arose, in part, because the assumptions behind the statistical procedures used were insufficiently examined, not only by the authors, but also by the reviewers. Our examples are instructive because the practitioners are highly reputed, their results have received enormous popular attention, and the journals that published their studies are among the most respected in the world. An educational bonus emerges from the difficulty we report in getting our critique published. We discuss the relevance of this episode to understanding statistical literacy and the role of scientific review, as well as to reforming statistics education.},

Potential benefits evolve around enhancing transparency and interactivity, as well as sharing information regularly or during emergency events. The purpose of this exploratory study is to advance our empirical understanding of microblogging in local government. In particular, we reflect on online data collected to profile the use of Twitter by 29 Greater London local authorities ({LAs).} The study shows that London {LAs} have been accumulating significant experience with Twitter mainly over the past two years. In fact, many of them appear to incorporate conversational characteristics in their Tweets other than simply disseminating information. Furthermore, an analysis of Tweets during the August 2011 riots in England indicates the usefulness of the medium for responsibly informing the public and preventing rumours. Nevertheless, the study also identifies several points of improvement in the way public authorities are building their online networks; for example, in terms of connecting with each other and exploiting even more the conversational characteristics of Twitter.},

Linguistic analyses of the journal entries revealed pronounced psychological changes in response to the attacks. In the short term, participants expressed more negative emotions, were more cognitively and socially engaged, and wrote with greater psychological distance. After 2 weeks, their moods and social referencing returned to baseline, and their use of cognitive-analytic words dropped below baseline. Over the next 6 weeks, social referencing decreased, and psychological distancing remained elevated relative to baseline. Although the effects were generally stronger for individuals highly preoccupied with September 11, even participants who hardly wrote about the events showed comparable language changes. This study bypasses many of the methodological obstacles of trauma research and provides a finegrained analysis of the time line of human coping with upheaval.},

How do political movements manifest new forums, promoting or resisting state power through social networking sites such as Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, or {YouTube?} How do states exert authority in the realm of digital activism? Unrest over official election results in Iran represents a case in which social media sites shape distinct sites wherein dissent is virtualized to challenge authoritarian rule, both offline and in cyberspace. Such cyberspaces of protest should be viewed in close connection with online governance through which the state can exert authority through surveillance operations, propaganda, and hacktivism. Online social media are agonistic arenas where information, ideas, values, and subjectivities are contested between (uneven) adversaries, and where new contexts could potentially emerge for new ways of doing politics.},

Network data have been obtained via surveys and questionnaires, archives, observation, diaries, electronic traces, and experiments. Most methodological research on data quality concerns surveys and questionnaires. The question of the accuracy with which informants can provide data on their network ties is nontrivial, but survey methods can make some claim to reliability. Unresolved issues include whether to measure perceived social ties or actual exchanges, how to treat temporal elements in the definition of relationships, and whether to seek accurate descriptions or reliable indicators. Continued research on data quality is needed; beyond improved samples and further investigation of the informant accuracy/reliability issue, this should cover common indices of network structure, address the consequences of sampling portions of a network, and examine the robustness of indicators of network structure and position to both random and nonrandom errors of measurement.},

We review some basic concepts of social network analysis, describe how to collect and analyze social network data, and demonstrate where social network data can be, and have been, used to study computer-mediated communication. Throughout, we show the utility of the social network approach for studying computer-mediated communication, be it in computer-supported cooperative work, in virtual community, or in more diffuse interactions over less bounded systems such as the Internet.},

In the empirical part of this study, we find that team creativity requires a moderate frequency of communication and a low level of communication centralization. Building on these results, in the second part of this paper, we present a three-factor model (member proximity, communication modality, team task structure) that addresses how creativity can be managed through the effective design and management of virtuality in {NPD} teams.

	abstract = {The multimedia content analysis community has made significant effort to bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics perceived by human cognitive systems such as real-world objects and concepts. In the two fields of multimedia analysis and brain imaging, both topics of low-level features and high level semantics are extensively studied. For instance, in the multimedia analysis field, many algorithms are available for multimedia feature extraction, and benchmark datasets are available such as the {TRECVID.} In the brain imaging field, brain regions that are responsible for vision, auditory perception, language, and working memory are well studied via functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} This paper presents our initial effort in marrying these two fields in order to bridge the gaps between low-level features and high-level semantics via {fMRI} brain imaging. Our experimental paradigm is that we performed {fMRI} brain imaging when university student subjects watched the video clips selected from the {TRECVID} datasets. At current stage, we focus on the three concepts of sports, weather, and commercial-/advertisement specified in the {TRECVID} 2005. Meanwhile, the brain regions in vision, auditory, language, and working memory networks are quantitatively localized and mapped via task-based paradigm {fMRI}, and the {fMRI} responses in these regions are used to extract features as the representation of the brain's comprehension of semantics. Our computational framework aims to learn the most relevant low-level feature sets that best correlate the {fMRI-derived} semantics based on the training videos with {fMRI} scans, and then the learned models are applied to larger scale test datasets without {fMRI} scans for category classifications. Our result shows that: 1) there are meaningful couplings between brain's {fMRI} responses and video stimuli, suggesting the validity of linking semantics and low-level features via {fMRI;} 2) The computationally learned low-level feature sets from {fMRI-derived} semantic features can significantly improve the classification of video categories in comparison with that based on original low-level features.},

	abstract = {In image retrieval, most systems lack user-centred evaluation since they are assessed by some chosen ground truth dataset. The results reported through precision and recall assessed against the ground truth are thought of as being an acceptable surrogate for the judgment of real users. Much current research focuses on automatically assigning keywords to images for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. However, evaluation methods are usually based on system-level assessment, e.g. classification accuracy based on some chosen ground truth dataset. In this paper, we present a qualitative evaluation methodology for automatic image indexing systems. The automatic indexing task is formulated as one of image annotation, or automatic metadata generation for images. The evaluation is composed of two individual methods. First, the automatic indexing annotation results are assessed by human subjects. Second, the subjects are asked to annotate some chosen images as the test set whose annotations are used as ground truth. Then, the system is tested by the test set whose annotation results are judged against the ground truth. Only one of these methods is reported for most systems on which user-centred evaluation are conducted. We believe that both methods need to be considered for full evaluation. We also provide an example evaluation of our system based on this methodology. According to this study, our proposed evaluation methodology is able to provide deeper understanding of the system’s performance.},

Recent advances in brain imaging and neuroscience in exploring the human brain's responses during multimedia comprehension demonstrated the possibility of leveraging cognitive neuroscience knowledge to bridge the semantic gaps. This paper presents our initial effort in this direction by using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} Specifically, task-based {fMRI} (T-{fMRI)} was performed to accurately localize the brain regions involved in video comprehension. Then, natural stimulus {fMRI} (N-{fMRI)} data were acquired when subjects watched the multimedia clips selected from the {TRECVID} datasets. The responses in the localized brain regions were measured and used to extract high-level features as the representation of the brain's comprehension of semantics in the videos. A novel computational framework was developed to learn the most relevant low-level feature sets that best correlate the {fMRI-derived} semantic features based on the training videos with {fMRI} scans, and then the learned model was applied to larger scale {TRECVID} video datasets without {fMRI} scans for category classification.

Drawing upon research from computer science, information studies, public policy, emergency management, and several other disciplines, the paper elaborates on the concept of and need for {CRGs}, examines related current efforts that can inform the development of {CRGs}, discusses how research about community networks can be used to instill trust and social capital in {CRGs}, and examines the issues of public policy, telecommunications, and e-government related to such a system.},

Through a longitudinal study and analysis of cumulative research data, we sought to answer the question, ‘what happened and why in knowledge building?’ Research data constitute messages which participants have written into a shared knowledge building database. A multi-method approach combing quantitative and qualitative data was adopted which integrated analysis of message generation, content analysis, network analysis, structure of message threads, discourse analysis and interviews. Conclusions are based on analysis of almost 2000 messages. Qualitative content analysis reveals 14 main categories of data. When the content of the messages are analysed, quantitatively cumulative trends emerge. When the frequencies of messages are plotted against time, peaks and troughs of message writing are revealed. The explanations for these patterns and variations are sought through interviews. Social network analysis shows that the network is centralised. The research literature suggests that decentralised networks are ideal, but in this particular case, the expert centralisation was beneficial for knowledge building in the collaborative and associated professional networks. The reasons for this are discussed.},

By wispy communities, we refer to social ties that exist within evanescent, limited micro-publics—worlds of action that are temporary, limited in time and space, and have the potential of being displaced by more insistent identities. We divide occasions into events and gatherings, and then divide gatherings into macro-groups (“nations,” such as Woodstock or Burning Man) and micro-groups (“fests,” including focused groups, such as the Lebowski Fest). A wispy community is a distinctive form of local affiliation that underscores both the communal features of occasions and their evanescent quality. In such communities relations are frequently intense, but after their conclusion relations slip into latent memory, available to be retrieved under proper circumstances.},

Last year, as candidates began preparing for the {U.S.} Presidential Primaries, {CNN} coined the term {YouTube-ification} of Politics to describe this development. From a perspective ascribing importance to everyday settings as venues for political expression, these Internet-based social media have become both the tools for and sites of politics. The question, however, is how such manifestations of political life can be empirically investigated within a social science theoretical framework.},

In 1995 and 1996, we interviewed a purposive sample of youth aged 14 through 21 who were living in Washington, {DC} and were identified on the streets or through shelters or other service agencies (N = 327). Although we found that most youth reported current social relationships, a significant minority (26\%) did not. Youth without a social network were significantly more likely to report current illicit drug use, multiple sex partners, and survival sex than youth with a network. For youth with a network, the networks were small, strong in affective and supportive qualities, comprised primarily of friends, typically included an alcohol or illicit drug user, and usually were not a source of pressure for risky behaviors. Our results indicate that networks had risk-enhancing and risk-decreasing properties in that network characteristics were associated in both positive and negative directions with risky behaviors.},

That focus has recently been called into question by scholars concerned with the process through which movement organizations expand their ranks and mobilize support for their causes. Yet, as Useem (1975) and Zald and {McCarthy} (1979) have noted, there has been little systematic research conducted on the details of the influence process. Drawing on data derived from a synthesis of existing research and two primary sources, this paper attempts to shed greater empirical and theoretical light on the movement recruitment process. The findings indicate that differential recruitment is not merely a function of dispositional susceptibility, but is strongly influenced by structural proximity, availability, and affective interaction with movement members. The findings also indicate that a movement organization's network attributes function as an important determinant of its recruitment strategies and growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Researchers and social observers have both believed that hashtags, as a new type of organizational objects of information, play a dual role in online microblogging communities (e.g., Twitter). On one hand, a hashtag serves as a bookmark of content, which links tweets with similar topics; on the other hand, a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community membership, which bridges a virtual community of users. Are the real users aware of this dual role of hashtags? Is the dual role affecting their behavior of adopting a hashtag? Is hashtag adoption predictable? We take the initiative to investigate and quantify the effects of the dual role on hashtag adoption. We propose comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of how a user selects content tags as well as joins communities. Experiments using large scale Twitter datasets prove the effectiveness of the dual role, where both the content measures and the community measures significantly correlate to hashtag adoption on Twitter. With these measures as features, a machine learning model can effectively predict the future adoption of hashtags that a user has never used before.},

Hashtags are a potent resource within this system for promoting the visibility of a Twitter update (and, by implication, the update’s author). This study analyses the frequency, types and grammatical context of hashtags which occurred in a dataset of approximately 92,000 tweets, taken from 100 publically available Twitter accounts, comparing the discourse styles of corporations, celebrity practitioners and ‘ordinary’ Twitter members. The results suggest that practices of self-branding and micro-celebrity operate on a continuum which reflects and reinforces the social and economic hierarchies which exist in offline contexts. Despite claims that hashtags are ‘conversational’, this study suggests that participatory culture in Twitter is not evenly distributed, and that the discourse of celebrity practitioners and corporations exhibits the synthetic personalization (Fairclough, 1989) typical of mainstream media forms of broadcast talk.},

	abstract = {Public figures require attention, whether from a constituency who votes them in or out of office, shareholders who decide their economic benefit to the corporation, or fans who judge their performances. However, on the periphery of this normal attention resides a very real risk; that of a much smaller group of individuals who lack the ability to discriminate between their own private fantasies and the figure's public behavior. They may be personally insulted by perceived betrayal, fanatically in love due to a perceived affectionate or sexual invitation, or simply preoccupied with the daily life of the public figure. Such individuals may fixate and do nothing more. Others communicate or approach in a disturbing way. A few will threaten. And on rare occasions, one will breach the public figure's security perimeter and attack. Stalking, Threatening, and Attacking Public Figures is a comprehensive survey of the current knowledge about stalking, violence risk, and threat management towards public figures. With contributions from forensic psychologists and psychiatrists, clinicians, researchers, attorneys, profilers, and current and former law enforcement professionals, this book is the first of its kind, international in scope, and rich in both depth and complexity. The book is divided into three sections which, in turn, focus upon defining, explaining, and risk managing this increasingly complex global reality. Chapters include detailed case studies, analyses of quantitative data, reflections from attachment theory and psychoanalytic thought, descriptions of law enforcement and protective organization activities, mental health and psychiatric categorizations and understandings, consideration of risk assessment models and variables, victim perspectives, and others.},

	abstract = {The {U.S.} Army's Opposing Force ({OPFOR)} is a 2,500-member brigade whose job is to help prepare soldiers for combat. Created to be the meanest, toughest foe that soldiers will ever face, {OPFOR} engages units-in-training in a variety of mock campaigns under a wide range of conditions. Every month, a fresh brigade of more than 4,000 soldiers takes on this standing enemy. {OPFOR}, which is stationed in the California desert, always has the home-court advantage. But the force being trained--called {BLU} {FOR--is} numerically and technologically superior. It possesses more resources and better, more available data. It is made up of experienced soldiers. And it knows just what to expect, because {OPFOR} shares its methods from previous campaigns with {BLUFOR's} commanders. In short, each {BLUFOR} brigade is given practically every edge. Yet {OPFOR} almost always wins. Underlying {OPFOR's} consistent success is the way it uses the after-action review ({AAR)}, a method for extracting lessons from one event or project and applying them to others. {AAR} meetings became a popular business tool after Shell Oil began experimenting with them in 1998. Most corporate {AARs}, however, are faint echoes of the rigorous reviews performed by {OPFOR.} Companies tend to treat the process as a pro-forma wrap-up, drawing lessons from an action but rarely learning them. {OPFOR's} {AARs}, by contrast, generate raw material that is fed back into the execution cycle. And while {OPFOR's} reviews extract numerous lessons, the brigade does not consider a lesson to be learned until it is successfully applied and validated. It might not make sense for companies to adopt {OPFOR's} {AAR} processes in their entirety, but four fundamentals are mandatory: Lessons must benefit the team that extracts them. The {AAR} process must start atthe beginning of the activity. Lessons must link explicitly to future actions. And leaders must hold everyone, especially themselves, accountable for learning.},

Not only are all of our business, scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools, and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and {knowledge.Like} the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by {KD} Nuggets readers, this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first edition, great progress has been made in the development of new data mining methods, systems, and applications. This new edition substantially enhances the first edition, and new chapters have been added to address recent developments on mining complex types of data- including stream data, sequence data, graph structured data, social network data, and multi-relational data. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a new student of data mining, this book has much to offer you:* A comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to know to get the most out of real business data.* Updates that incorporate input from readers, changes in the field, and more material on statistics and machine learning.* Dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in easily understood pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects.* Complete classroom support for instructors at www.mkp.com/datamining2e companion site.},

The Bayes formula gives a range of probabilities to which the document can be assigned according to a predetermined set of topics (categories) such as those found in the "20 Newsgroups" data set for instance. Using this probability distribution as the vectors to represent the document, the {SVM} can then be used to classify the documents on a multidimensional level. The effects of an inadvertent dimensionality reduction caused by classifying using only the highest probability using the naive Bayes classifier can be overcome using the {SVM} by employing all the probability values associated with every category for each document. This method can be used for any data set and shows a significant reduction in training time as compared to the Lsquare method and significant improvement in the classification accuracy when compared to pure naive Bayes systems and also the {TF-IDF/SVM} hybrids.},

Going well beyond any of the previously published reports on the Excellence study, this book contains many new statistical analyses of the survey data and more details from the case studies. Discussing theory and data related to several ongoing discussions in the communication profession, this book answers the following questions:  {*How} can we show the value of public relations?  {*What} is the value of relationships?  {*How} do relationships affect reputation?  {*What} does it mean to practice communication strategically?  {*How} can we measure and evaluate the effects of public relations programs?  {*Should} communication programs be integrated?  {*How} does the new female majority in the profession affect communication Excellence?   This book, as well as the research it reports, is the product of symmetrical communication and collaboration. As such, it is intended for scholars, applied researchers, students, and informed professionals who understand the value of research in developing a profession, such as public relations. Knowledge of quantitative and qualitative research methods will make it easier to understand the book; however, the results are interpreted in a way that makes the analyses understandable even to those with little or no knowledge of statistics and research methods.},

Using a national sample of {US} adults, this study investigated the relationship between these three dimensions of the Big-Five model and social media use (defined as use of social networking sites and instant messages). It also examined whether gender and age played a role in that dynamic. Results revealed that while extraversion and openness to experiences were positively related to social media use, emotional stability was a negative predictor, controlling for socio-demographics and life satisfaction. These findings differed by gender and age. While extraverted men and women were both likely to be more frequent users of social media tools, only the men with greater degrees of emotional instability were more regular users. The relationship between extraversion and social media use was particularly important among the young adult cohort. Conversely, being open to new experiences emerged as an important personality predictor of social media use for the more mature segment of the sample.},

Learning to use blogs (“web logs,” web pages that are regularly updated with links and opinion), wikis (web pages that non-programmers can edit easily), podcasts (digital radio productions distributed through the Internet), and digital video as media of self-expression, with an emphasis on “public voice,” should be considered a pillar—not just a component—of twenty-first-century civic curriculum. Participatory media that enable young people to create as well as consume media are popular among high school and college students. Introducing the use of these media in the context of the public sphere is an appropriate intervention for educators because the rhetoric of democratic participation is not necessarily learnable by self-guided point-and-click experimentation. The participatory characteristics of online digital media are described, examples briefly cited, the connection between individual expression and public opinion discussed, and specific exercises for developing a public voice through blogs, wikis, and podcasts are suggested.

	abstract = {Social media forms a central domain for the production and dissemination of real-time information. Even though such flows of information have traditionally been thought of as diffusion processes over social networks, the underlying phenomena are the result of a complex web of interactions among numerous participants. Here we develop the Linear Influence Model where rather than requiring the knowledge of the social network and then modeling the diffusion by predicting which node will influence which other nodes in the network, we focus on modeling the global influence of a node on the rate of diffusion through the (implicit) network. We model the number of newly infected nodes as a function of which other nodes got infected in the past. For each node we estimate an influence function that quantifies how many subsequent infections can be attributed to the influence of that node over time. A nonparametric formulation of the model leads to a simple least squares problem that can be solved on large datasets. We validate our model on a set of 500 million tweets and a set of 170 million news articles and blog posts. We show that the Linear Influence Model accurately models influences of nodes and reliably predicts the temporal dynamics of information diffusion. We find that patterns of influence of individual participants differ significantly depending on the type of the node and the topic of the information.},

Subcultural theorists argue that youths become delinquent through peer socialization in youth gangs. Control theorists, by contrast, argue that adolescents become delinquent and associate with delinquent others because they have weakened bonds to the conventional order. Our paper examines the role of social bonds and group structure in the generation of delinquency through the application of social network analysis. Our findings support the control explanation; those members who have the weakest bonds, regardless of gang participation, are the most delinquent (as measured by delinquent attitudes). While our results indicate that companionship (by itself) does not lead youths to become delinquent, we argue that it is still important in the explanation of delinquency.},

Psychopathy was determined using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised ({PCL-R).} The Wmatrix linguistic analysis tool (Rayson, 2008) was used to examine parts of speech and semantic content while the Dictionary of Affect and Language ({DAL)} tool (Whissell \& Dewson, 1986) was used to examine the emotional characteristics of the {narratives.Results.} Psychopaths (relative to their counterparts) included more rational cause-and-effect descriptors (e.g., ‘because’, ‘since’), focused on material needs (food, drink, money), and contained fewer references to social needs (family, religion/spirituality). Psychopaths’ speech contained a higher frequency of disfluencies (‘uh’, ‘um’) indicating that describing such a powerful, ‘emotional’ event to another person was relatively difficult for them. Finally, psychopaths used more past tense and less present tense verbs in their narrative, indicating a greater psychological detachment from the incident, and their language was less emotionally intense and {pleasant.Conclusions.} These language differences, presumably beyond conscious control, support the notion that psychopaths operate on a primitive but rational level.},

We show that, generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular we demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects, and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and their choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. We also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.},

	abstract = {Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.},

Both Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour and Beveren's lesser known Flow Theory model are examined in detail, and when jointly applied to the domain of computer hacking are found to explain many of the observed characteristics of early hacker activity. It is shown that flow theory provides a rationale for the development of hackers from new entrants to skilled hackers, and potentially on to cyber criminals. The Beveren model of hacker development is expanded to incorporate additional cyber actors existing in the cybercrime and information warfare fields. The implications of this model are discussed, and using results from the Theory of Planned Behaviour a number of significant control variables are identified. Police strategies for addressing cyber crime, and hacking in parti-cular, are considered and a comprehensive approach to proactively reducing the proclivity of teenagers to start hacking is proposed, as an important early step in addressing the more serious issue of computer {crime.Security} Journal (2007) 20, 236–251. doi:10.1057/palgrave.sj.8350019 [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR];} Copyright of Security Journal is the property of Palgrave Macmillan Ltd. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	abstract = {The paper systematizes the role of qualitative methods, statistical analyses, and formal network analysis in sociological network research, and argues for their systematic combination. Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures as well as at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used in order to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).},

	abstract = {There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line, but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. Here we study this issue on Twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users. We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in "stickiness," the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of "persistence" - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects. We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale validation of the "complex contagion" principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. Among other findings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure. We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again finding structural differences across topics. We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.},

However, it happens at the most politically sensitive times and has widespread—if not global—consequences for political, economic and cultural life. When do states disconnect their digital networks, and why? To answer this question, the authors build an event history database of incidents in which a regime went beyond mere censorship of particular websites or users. The authors draw from multiple sources, including major news media, specialized news services, and international experts, to construct an event log database of 566 incidents. This rich, original dataset allows for a nuanced analysis of the conditions for state action, and the authors offer some assessment of the effect of such desperate action. Comparative analysis indicates that both democratic and authoritarian regimes disable social media networks for citing concerns about national security, protecting authority figures, and preserving cultural and religious morals. Whereas democracies disable social media with the goal of protecting children, authoritarian regimes also attempt to eliminate what they perceive as propaganda on social media. The authors cover the period 1995–2011 and build a grounded typology on the basis of regime type, what states actually did to interfere with digital networks, why they did it, and who was affected.},

This research is based on the premise that the motivations behind any sort of crimes—and it is no different with cybercrimes, and more specifically in this article with computer hacking crimes—are a product of human society and, even when they present new methods and tools, its human nature that leads criminals to, sooner or later, commit mistakes. Therefore, the objective of this article is to link criminal profiling to computer hacking, identifying expressions of human psychological traits and adding new elements to digital investigation.

	abstract = {Online social media are complementing and in some cases replacing person-to-person social interaction and redefining the diffusion of information. In particular, microblogs have become crucial grounds on which public relations, marketing, and political battles are fought. We introduce an extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging events. We describe a Web service that leverages this framework to track political memes in Twitter and help detect astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of {U.S.} political elections. We present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by our service. Finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced annotations.},

A lack of this knowledge can have grave consequences. Conversely, understanding adversary culture can make a positive difference strategically, operationally, and tactically. Although success in future operations will depend on cultural knowledge, the Department of Defense currently lacks the programs, systems, models, personnel, and organizations to deal with either the existing threat or the changing environment. A Federal initiative is urgently needed to incorporate cultural and social knowledge of adversaries into training, education, planning, intelligence, and operations. Across the board, the national security structure needs to be infused with anthropology, a discipline invented to support warfighting in the tribal zone.},

	abstract = {The {U.S.} intelligence community ({IC)} is a complex human enterprise whose success depends on how well the people in it perform their work. Although often aided by sophisticated technologies, these people ultimately rely on their own intellect to identify, synthesize, and communicate the information on which the nation's security depends. The {IC's} success depends on having trained, motivated, and thoughtful people working within organizations able to understand, value, and coordinate their capabilities. Intelligence Analysis provides up-to-date scientific guidance for the intelligence community ({IC)} so that it might improve individual and group judgments, communication between analysts, and analytic processes. The papers in this volume provide the detailed evidentiary base for the National Research Council's report, Intelligence Analysis for Tomorrow: Advances from the Behavioral and Social Sciences. The opening chapter focuses on the structure, missions, operations, and characteristics of the {IC} while the following 12 papers provide in-depth reviews of key topics in three areas: analytic methods, analysts, and organizations. Informed by the {IC's} unique missions and constraints, each paper documents the latest advancements of the relevant science and is a stand-alone resource for the {IC's} leadership and workforce. The collection allows readers to focus on one area of interest (analytic methods, analysts, or organizations) or even one particular aspect of a category. As a collection, the volume provides a broad perspective of the issues involved in making difficult decisions, which is at the heart of intelligence analysis.},

We summarize here the major sources of evidence for chunking mechanisms, and consider how such mechanisms have been implemented in computational models of the learning process. We distinguish two forms of chunking: the first deliberate, under strategic control, and goal-oriented; the second automatic, continuous, and linked to perceptual processes. Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long- and short-term memory ({EPAM/CHREST)} has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking. We focus on recent successes in verbal learning, expert memory, language acquisition and learning multiple representations, to illustrate the implementation and use of chunking mechanisms within contemporary models of human learning.},

Yet clusters, or geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, are a striking feature of virtually every national, regional, state, and even metropolitan economy, especially in more advanced nations. The prevalence of clusters reveals important insights about the microeconomics of competition and the role of location in competitive advantage. Even as old reasons for clustering have diminished in importance with globalization, new influences of clusters on competition have taken on growing importance in an increasingly complex, knowledge-based, and dynamic economy. Clusters represent a new way of thinking about national, state, and local economies, and they necessitate new roles for companies, government, and other institutions in enhancing competitiveness.},

	abstract = {Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends—except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.},

Here we study gender-specific differences of a multiplex network from a complete behavioral dataset of an online-game society of about 300,000 players. On the individual level females perform better economically and are less risk-taking than males. Males reciprocate friendship requests from females faster than vice versa and hesitate to reciprocate hostile actions of females. On the network level females have more communication partners, who are less connected than partners of males. We find a strong homophily effect for females and higher clustering coefficients of females in trade and attack networks. Cooperative links between males are under-represented, reflecting competition for resources among males. These results confirm quantitatively that females and males manage their social networks in substantially different ways.},

A good meta-analysis will highlight and delineate the subjective components of these processes and vigorously search for sources of heterogeneity. Unfortunately, these objectives are not always met by common techniques. For example, a scatterplot is an objective summarization if the data are uncensored, but inferred patterns should be regarded as subjective recognitions of the analyst, not objective data properties. Random-effects summaries encourage averaging over important data patterns, divert attention from key sources of heterogeneity, and can amplify distortions produced by publication bias; such summaries should only be used when important heterogeneity remains after a thorough search for the sources of such heterogeneity. Quality scoring adds the analyst's subjective bias to the results, wastes information, and can prevent the recognition of key sources of heterogeneity; it should be completely replaced by meta-regression on quality items (the score components).

The authors hypothesized that these trends arise despite the multiple sources of variation in patient testing because numerous factors that structure semantic memory probabilistically converge to make some categories of knowledge more susceptible to damage than others. Analysis of semantic feature norms and corpus data for 541 concepts revealed that differences in the distribution of knowledge types across categories are sufficient to explain 6 of the trends and are necessary to explain loss of knowledge about nonliving things. Feature informativeness, concept confusability, visual complexity, familiarity, and name frequency contributed to this patterning and provide insight into why knowledge about living things is most often impaired.},

Using theories of status seeking and self-presentation, we investigate the ways in which consumers construct status in online consumer communities. The data reveal insights into the strategies behind constructing a digital status and the rise of online systems to promote celebrity status within online communities.},

	abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity {MRI} ({fcMRI)} is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While {fcMRI} does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. {fcMRI} is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics—high angular resolution diffusion imaging ({HARDI).} We review what is known about {fcMRI} and then explore {fcMRI} data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2–12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced {fcMRI} results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of {fcMRI} positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of {fcMRI} and how it can be combined with {HARDI} techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

Sentiments about vaccination can strongly affect individual vaccination decisions. Measuring such sentiments - and how they are distributed in a population - is typically a difficult and resource-intensive endeavor. We use publicly available data from Twitter, a popular online social media service, to measure the evolution and distribution of sentiments towards the novel influenza A({H1N1)} vaccine during the second half of 2009, i.e. the fall wave of the {H1N1} (swine flu) pandemic. We find that projected vaccination rates based on sentiments expressed on Twitter are in very good agreement with vaccination rates estimated by the {CDC} with traditional phone surveys. Looking at the online social network, we find that both negative and positive opinions are clustered, and that an equivalent level of clustering of vaccinations in a population would strongly increase disease outbreak risks.},

The challenges of utilizing social media data include that the volume of data is large but distributed and of a highly unstructured form. Appropriate data gathering, scrubbing and aggregating efforts for these data are required to transform them for meaningful use. In this paper, we discuss such a social media data {ETL} (Extract-Transform-Load) method, to provide a user-friendly, dynamic method for visualizing outbreaks and the spread of developing epidemics in space and time. We have developed the Epidemics Outbreak and Spread Detection System ({EOSDS)} as a prototype that makes use of the rich information retrievable in real time from Twitter. {EOSDS} provides three different visualization methods of spreading epidemics, static map, distribution map, and filter map, to investigate public health threats in the space and time dimensions. The results of these visualizations in our experiments correlate well with relevant {CDC} official reports, a gold standard used by health informatics scientists. In our experiments, the {EOSDS} also detected an unusual situation not shown in the {CDC} reports, but confirmed by online news media.},

The 2nd, in the 1970s and 1980s, was characterized by attempts to measure curiosity and assess its dimensionality. This article reviews these contributions with a concentration on the 1st wave. It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding.},

Friendship networks and antisocial influences conveyed by them have an impact on the spread of criminal behavior. However, there are relatively few studies reporting on the use of statistical network models in the analysis of delinquency data. The purpose here is to discuss statistical network models that might be appropriate for estimating joint participation in crime and the structure of co-offending youth networks. The discussion is largely based on problems encountered in some recent exploratory studies of juvenile crime in Stockholm with register data from the police on suspected offenders. A bipartite graph model of such data is built from assumptions about crime reporting and offender detection for a specific type of crimes committed in a certain area during a certain time period. It is shown how the model parameters and the numbers of crimes of different sizes, the numbers of offenders of different activities, and the total number of offences can be estimated from data about reported crimes and police identified offenders. The illustrations also show the need for further statistical development.},

However, considerably less attention has been paid to learned characteristics of relationships that affect the decision to seek information from other people. Based on a review of the social network, information processing, and organizational learning literatures, along with the results of a previous qualitative study, we propose a formal model of information seeking in which the probability of seeking information from another person is a function of (1) knowing what that person knows; (2) valuing what that person knows; (3) being able to gain timely access to that person's thinking; and (4) perceiving that seeking information from that person would not be too costly. We also hypothesize that the knowing, access, and cost variables mediate the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking. The model is tested using two separate research sites to provide replication. The results indicate strong support for the model and the mediation hypothesis (with the exception of the cost variable). Implications are drawn for the study of both transactive memory and organizational learning, as well as for management practice.},

That may account for the astounding number of recent poor calls, such as decisions to invest in and securitize subprime mortgage loans or to hedge risk with credit default swaps. Business books are rich with insights about the decision process, but organizations have been slow to adopt their recommendations. It's time to focus on decision making, Davenport says, and he proposes four steps: (1) List and prioritize the decisions that must be made; (2) assess the factors that go into each, such as who plays what role, how often the decision must be made, and what information is available to support it; (3) design the roles, processes, systems, and behaviors your organization needs; and (4) institutionalize decision tools and assistance. The Educational Testing Service and The Stanley Works, among others, have succeeded in improving their decisions. {ETS} established a centralized deliberative body to make evidence-based decisions about new-product offerings, and Stanley has a Pricing Center of Excellence with internal consultants dedicated to its various business units. Leaders should bring multiple perspectives to their decision making, beware of analytical models that managers don't understand, be clear about their assumptions, practice "model management," and -- because only people can revise decision criteria over time -- cultivate human backups.},

	abstract = {Saying that networks are important is stating the obvious. But harnessing the power of these seemingly invisible groups to achieve organizational goals is an elusive undertaking. Most efforts to promote collaboration are haphazard and built on the implicit philosophy that more connectivity is better. In truth, networks create relational demands that sap people's time and energy and can bog down entire organizations. It's crucial for executives to learn how to promote connectivity only where it benefits an organization or individual and to decrease unnecessary connections. In this article, the authors introduce three types of social networks, each of which delivers unique value. The customized response network excels at framing the ambiguous problems involved in innovation. Strategy consulting firms and new-product development groups rely on this format. By contrast, surgical teams and law firms rely mostly on the modular response network, which works best when components of the problem are known but the sequence of those components in the solution is unknown. And the routine response network is best suited for organizations like call centers, where the problems and solutions are fairly predictable but collaboration is still needed. Executives shouldn't simply hope that collaboration will spontaneously occur in the right places atthe right times in their organization. They need to develop a strategic, nuanced view of collaboration, and they must take steps to ensure that their companies support the types of social networks that best fit their goals. Drawing on examples from Novartis, the {FAA}, and Sallie Mae, the authors offer managers the tools they need to determine which network will deliver the best results for their organizations and which strategic investments will nurture the right degree of connectivity.},

The relationship between mental illness and violence has a significant effect on mental health policy, clinical practice, and public opinion about the dangerousness of people with psychiatric {disorders.Objective}
To use a longitudinal data set representative of the {US} population to clarify whether or how severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression lead to violent {behavior.Design}
Data on mental disorder and violence were collected as part of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ({NESARC)}, a 2-wave face-to-face survey conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and {Alcoholism.Participants}
A total of 34 653 subjects completed {NESARC} waves 1 (2001-2003) and 2 (2004-2005) interviews. Wave 1 data on severe mental illness and risk factors were analyzed to predict wave 2 data on violent {behavior.Main} Outcome Measures
Reported violent acts committed between waves 1 and {2.Results}
Bivariate analyses showed that the incidence of violence was higher for people with severe mental illness, but only significantly so for those with co-occurring substance abuse and/or dependence. Multivariate analyses revealed that severe mental illness alone did not predict future violence; it was associated instead with historical (past violence, juvenile detention, physical abuse, parental arrest record), clinical (substance abuse, perceived threats), dispositional (age, sex, income), and contextual (recent divorce, unemployment, victimization) factors. Most of these factors were endorsed more often by subjects with severe mental {illness.Conclusions}
Because severe mental illness did not independently predict future violent behavior, these findings challenge perceptions that mental illness is a leading cause of violence in the general population. Still, people with mental illness did report violence more often, largely because they showed other factors associated with violence. Consequently, understanding the link between violent acts and mental disorder requires consideration of its association with other variables such as substance abuse, environmental stressors, and history of violence.},

	abstract = {Information popularity and social relationships are intimately connected. However, measuring the extent to which they affect each other has remained an open question. Because we now have access to rich and large data sets from online social networks, we can begin to quantitatively understand the interplay between them. We examine the interface of two decisive structures forming the backbone of online social media: the graph structure of social networks - who is friends with whom - and the set structure of topical affiliations - who talks about what. In studying this interface, we identify key relationships whereby each of these structures can be understood in terms of the other. The context for our study is Twitter, where we look at the social network of both follower relationships and communication relationships, alongside the affiliations outlined by the hashtags used by people to label their communications. On Twitter, we demonstrate how the hashtags that a user adopts can be used to predict their social relationships, and also how the social relationships between the adopters of a hashtag can be used to predict the future popularity of that hashtag. Importantly, we find that both relationships are driven by highly computationally simple structural determinants. While our analysis focuses on Twitter, we view our analysis of social-topical affiliations as broadly applicable to a host of diverse affiliations, including the movies people watch, the brands people like, or the locations people frequent.},

This article presents a global and international perspective on Katrina as a case of “grand failure” in crisis and emergency management, with lessons and implications for future crisis management. Benefiting from empirical data collected from international interviews, the essay presents a theoretical analysis of emergency governance and crisis management, discusses a detailed global perspective on Katrina crisis management as “management and leadership crisis,” offers a number of key lessons learned from Katrina, and draws policy and administrative recommendations for future crisis and emergency management through a theory of “surprise management” that is adaptive, collaborative, and citizen engaging and draws on chaos and complexity theories to cope with hyper-uncertainties and unknowns.},

An historical account of research endeavours in content-based retrieval, directed towards the automation of these operations in digital image scenarios, provides the main thrust of the paper. Finally, a look forwards locates visual information retrieval research within the wider context of content-based multimedia retrieval.},

Information and communication technologies ({ICTs)} are seen by many as a cost-effective and convenient means to promote openness and transparency and to reduce corruption. E-government, in particular, has been used in many prominent, comprehensive transparency efforts in a number of nations. While some of these individual efforts have received considerable attention, the issue of whether these {ICT-enabled} efforts have the potential to create a substantive social change in attitudes toward transparency has not been widely considered. This paper explores the potential impacts of information and {ICTs} – especially e-government and social media – on cultural attitudes about transparency.},

It does this by associating with each user-defined activity the set of files, folders, email messages, contacts, and web pages that the user accesses when performing that activity. The initial {TaskTracer} system relies on the user to notify the system each time the user changes activities. However, this is burdensome, and users often forget to tell {TaskTracer} what activity they are working on. This paper introduces {TaskPredictor}, a machine learning system that attempts to predict the user's current activity. {TaskPredictor} has two components: one for general desktop activity and another specifically for email. {TaskPredictor} achieves high prediction precision by combining three techniques: (a) feature selection via mutual information, (b) classification based on a confidence threshold, and (c) a hybrid design in which a Naive Bayes classifier estimates the classification confidence but where the actual classification decision is made by a support vector machine. This paper provides experimental results on data collected from {TaskTracer} users.},

	abstract = {There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line, but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. Here we study this issue on Twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users. We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in "stickiness," the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of "persistence" - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects. We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale validation of the "complex contagion" principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. Among other findings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure. We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again finding structural differences across topics. We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.},

	shorttitle = {Threatening Communications and Behavior},
	abstract = {Today's world of rapid social, technological, and behavioral change provides new opportunities for communications with few limitations of time and space. Through these communications, people leave behind an ever-growing collection of traces of their daily activities, including digital footprints provided by text, voice, and other modes of communication. Meanwhile, new techniques for aggregating and evaluating diverse and multimodal information sources are available to security services that must reliably identify communications indicating a high likelihood of future violence. In the context of this changed and changing world of communications and behavior, the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences of the National Research Council presents this volume of three papers as one portion of the vast subject of threatening communications and behavior. The papers review the behavioral and social sciences research on the likelihood that someone who engages in abnormal and/or threatening communications will actually then try to do harm. The focus is on how the scientific knowledge can inform and advance future research on threat assessments, in part by considering the approaches and techniques used to analyze communications and behavior in the dynamic context of today's world. The papers in the collection were written within the context of protecting high-profile public figures from potential attach or harm. The research, however, is broadly applicable to {U.S.} national security including potential applications for analysis of communications from leaders of hostile nations and public threats from terrorist groups. This work highlights the complex psychology of threatening communications and behavior, and it offers knowledge and perspectives from multiple domains that contribute to a deeper understanding of the value of communications in predicting and preventing violent behaviors.},

	abstract = {Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management ({KM)}, {IS} researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems ({KMS).} The objective of {KMS} is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of {KMS} requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, {KMS} research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of {IT} in support of these processes.},

In particular, we analyze the activity related to the 2010 earthquake in Chile and characterize Twitter in the hours and days following this disaster. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study of certain social phenomenons, such as the dissemination of false rumors and confirmed news. We analyze how this information propagated through the Twitter network, with the purpose of assessing the reliability of Twitter as an information source under extreme circumstances. Our analysis shows that the propagation of tweets that correspond to rumors differs from tweets that spread news because rumors tend to be questioned more than news by the Twitter community. This result shows that it is posible to detect rumors by using aggregate analysis on tweets.},

Dervin's (1983) theory of sense-making applied to crises and communications during crises, we examined 7,184 microblogging communications sent in response to three violent crises that occurred on {U.S.} college campuses. The analysis of patterns of microblogging communications found that information-sharing behaviors dominated the early response phase of violent crises, and opinion sharing increased over time, peaking in the recovery phase of the crises. The analysis of individual microblogging communications identified various themes in the conversation threads that not only helped individual contributors make sense of the situation but also helped others who followed the conversation. The results of this study show that microblogging can play a vital role in collective sense-making during crises.},
