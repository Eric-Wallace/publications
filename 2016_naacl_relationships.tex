\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Understanding how a fictional relationship between two characters changes over
  time (e.g., from best friends to sworn enemies) is a key challenge in digital
  humanities scholarship.  We present a novel unsupervised neural network for
  this task that incorporates dictionary learning to generate interpretable,
  accurate relationship trajectories. While previous work on characterizing
  literary relationships relies on plot summaries annotated with predefined
  labels, our model jointly learns a set of global relationship descriptors as
  well as a trajectory over these descriptors for each relationship in a dataset
  of raw text from novels. We find that our model learns descriptors of events
  (e.g., marriage or murder) as well as interpersonal states (love,
  sadness). Our model outperforms topic model baselines on two crowdsourced
  tasks, and we also find interesting correlations to annotations in an existing
  dataset.
