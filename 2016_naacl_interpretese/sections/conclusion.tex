\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

While we describe how \trans{} and \inter{} are different and
characterize \emph{how} they differ, the contribution of our work is
not just examining an interesting, important dialect.  Our work
provides opportunities to improve conventional simultaneous MT systems
by exploiting and modeling human tactics.  \newcite{he15rewrite} use
hand-crafted rules to decrease latency; our data-driven approach could
yield additional strategies for improving \abr{mt} systems.  Another
strategy---given the scarcity and artifacts of interpretation
corpus---is to select references that present delay-minimizing
features of \inter{} from translation
corpus~\cite{axelrod11selection}.  Another future direction is to
investigate cognitive inference~\cite{inference-in-interpretation},
which is useful for semantic/syntactic prediction during
interpretation~\cite{grissom14simtrans,oda15acl}.
