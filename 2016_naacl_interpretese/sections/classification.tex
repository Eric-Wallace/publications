\section{Distinguishing \trans{} and \inter{}}
\label{sec:distinguish}

In this section, we discuss strategies used in \inter{}, which we
detect automatically in the next section.  Our hypothesis is that
tactics used by interpreters roughly fall in two non-exclusive
categories: (i) \emph{delay minimization}, to enable prompt
translation by arranging target words in an order similar to the
source; (ii) \emph{memory footprint minimization}, to avoid
overloading working memory by reducing communicated information.








\paragraph{Segmentation}

Interpreters often break source sentences into multiple smaller
sentences~\cite{erik11theory,shimizu13iwslt}, a process we call segmentation.
This is different from what is commonly used in speech translation
systems~\cite{fujita13timing,oda14segmentation}, where translations of segments
are directly concatenated.  Instead, humans try to incorporate new information
into the precedent partial translation, e.g., using ``which is'' to put it in a
clause (Table~\ref{tab:examples}, Example~3), or creating a new sentence joined
by conjunctions (Table~\ref{tab:examples}, Example~5).

\paragraph{Passivization}

Passivization is useful for interpreting from head-final
languages (e.g., Japanese, German) to head-initial languages (e.g., English,
French)~\cite{he15rewrite}.  Because the verb is needed early in the target sentence but only
appears at the end of the source sentence, an obvious strategy is to wait for the final
verb.  However, if the interpreter uses passive voice, they can start translating
immediately and append the verb at the end (Table~\ref{tab:examples},
Examples~3--4).  During passivization, the subject is often omitted when obvious
from context.


















\paragraph{Generalization}

\newcite{erik11theory} and \newcite{raja00strategy} observe that interpreters
focus on delivering the gist of a sentence rather than duplicating the
nuanced meaning of each word.  More frequent words are chosen as their
retrieval time is faster~\cite{dell92access,cuetos06access} (e.g.,
``honorific'' versus ``polite'' in Table~\ref{tab:examples},
Example~1).  Although \newcite{volansky13feats} show that
generalization happens in translation too, it is likely more frequent
in \inter{} given the severe time constraints.

\paragraph{Summarization}

Faced with overwhelming information, interpreters need efficient ways to
encode meaning.  Less important words, or even a whole sentence can drop,
especially when the interpreter falls behind the speaker.  In
Table~\ref{tab:examples}, Example~2, the literal translation ``as much as
possible'' is reduced to ``very'', and the adjective ``Japanese'' is omitted.

\paragraph{}

Before we study these characteristics quantitatively in the next section, we
visualize \inter{} and \trans{} by a word cloud in Figure~\ref{fig:wordle}.  The
size of each word is proportional to the difference between its frequencies in
\inter{} and \trans{} (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).  The word color indicates
whether it is more frequent in \inter{} (blue) or \trans{} (red).  ``the'' is
over-represented in \inter{}, a phenomenon also occurs in \trans{} v.s. the
original text~\cite{eetemadi14feats}.  More conjunction words (e.g., ``and'',
``so'', ``or'', ``then'') are used in \inter{}, likely for segmentation, whereas
``that'' is more frequent in \trans{}---a sign of clauses.  In addition, the
pronoun ``I'' occurs more often in \trans{} while ``be'' and ``is'' occur more
often in \inter{}, which is consistent with our passivization hypothesis.
