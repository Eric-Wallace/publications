\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces a new, naturally-occuring coreference dataset
that is easy to annotate but difficult for computers to solve. We show that active learning allows us to create a dataset that is rich in different types of coreference. We develop an end-to-end coreference system using very simple mention detection and pairwise classification models that outperforms traditional systems on our dataset.
The next challenge is to incorporate the necessary world knowledge to
solve these harder coreference problems. Systems should be able to
distinguish who is likely to marry whom, identify the titles of books from
roundabout descriptions, and intuit family relationships from raw
text. These are coreference challenges not found in newswire but that
do exist in the real world. Unlike other \abr{ai}-complete problems like machine translation,
coreference in challenging datasets is easy to both annotate and
evaluate. This paper provides the necessary building blocks to create
and evaluate those systems.
