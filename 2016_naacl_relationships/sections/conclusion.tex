\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We formalize the task of unsupervised relationship modeling, which
involves learning a set of relationship descriptors as well as a trajectory over
these descriptors for each relationship in an input dataset. We present the
\rmn, a novel neural network architecture for this task that generates more
interpretable descriptors and trajectories than topic model baselines. Finally,
we show that the output of our model can lead to interesting insights when
combined with annotations in an existing dataset.
